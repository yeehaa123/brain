## The Challenges

* Unequal opportunities for entrepreneurs
* Talented and creative self-taught individuals lack proper guidance, structure and resources to grow
* Lack of customization in creative development
* Limited access to low-threshold, accessible learning methods and trajectories
* Gap between dream and reality for 'self-made' individuals

## Our Vision

We imagine a future of the creative industry where creative dreams are realized collectively.

Rather than chasing the dragon of individual success, we recognize that talent is best developed in a supportive, entrepreneurial community.

We want to make such a community available to everyone.
