# Lumii x Rizom Collaboration 

## Executive Summary

Through a strategic partnership with Rizom, Lumii will be able to quickly validate product-market fit. Through a crowdfunding campaign that showcases the combined, total hardware and software proposition that Lumii will offer, we effectively validate whether parents are willing to invest in this solution or not. 

Rizom brings a flexible, venture-building model — adapting its resources, talent mix, and strategies which could match Lumii’s evolving needs, ensuring we pivot quickly when new insights emerge. 

Collaborating together on a clearly defined pilot project allows us to validate whether the Rizom and Lumii partnership is fruitful with minimal risk.


## The Opportunity

Lumii has developed an innovative hardware prototype that has the potential to solve the global myopia problem. It has decided to explore the direct to consumer route before trying to offer their unique sensor module to OEMs.


Lumii is aware that it cannot be a hardware solution alone. since the solution is primarily focused on children and adolescents, a playful engagement loop is a requirement. This gamification system (which may involve multiple channel partners), however, still needs to be developed from scratch. Which is costly as long as the product-market fit for the hardware solution has not been established.

Instead of investing substantial amounts of money in building this gamification ecosystem right away, Rizom believes that it is better to first test whether this solution resonates with the end-users: parents and children.


### Key risks:

- Upfront development costs could be stellar without clear proof of ROI
- Parents love it, children hate it
- Customers like the solution in theory, but are not willing to pay a premium for it


## The Solution

Instead of developing the software upfront, Lumii and Rizom will first collaborate on launching a crowdfunding campaign. Goal of this pilot project is to validate project-market phase.

Key in preparing this campaign is developing a so-called [visiontype](https://designmap.com/ideas/visiontypes-create-and-share-a-product-vision). A visiontype is comparable to a prototype but differs in one important way. Rather than showing the simplest version of the product, it showcases how a product could look like in 3 years. 

Once we have this visiontype, we can derive the artifacts (screenshots and descriptions) needed for the kickstarter campaign. This way, we validate the entire product ecosystem in the fastest and most cost-effective way.


## Project Objectives

The project is designed to:

1. Validate Pinehurst’s venture studio model by testing a structured, outcome-based transformation project with Baiwin Collection
2. Develop a repeatable playbook for converting legacy businesses into digital-first ventures, to strengthen Pinehurst’s studio offering
3. Build and test a proof of concept (prototype → MVP → validated solution) that Pinehurst can use as a case study for future clients
3. Test and document customer acquisition strategies and product–market fit signals, giving Pinehurst data-driven evidence of what works in the Taiwan market
4. Capture intellectual property (processes, workflows, templates) that Pinehurst can reuse and scale across future portfolio companies
5. Validate the Pinehurst–Rizom collaboration model, ensuring Pinehurst can scale faster with a flexible, adaptive partner
6. De-risk future investments for Pinehurst by proving feasibility and market traction before committing significant capital


## Project Timeline & Deliverables

| Phase | Timeline | Deliverables |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Discovery | 6 weeks | Roadmap + budget estimation (Go / No-Go) |
| Execution 1 | 6 weeks | Prototype |
| Execution 2 | 6 weeks | MVP |
| Execution 3 | 6 weeks | V/alidated solution & scalable plan |


## Proposal

In order to correctly assess and evaluate scope and resources needed for building the actual MVP we want to start off with a discovery phase to build up our roadmap for the coming months. Below is a detailed outline of what we would need process and resources wise. 

### Discovery Phase Breakdown
**Objective**: Evaluate feasibility, create roadmap & budget for MVP
**Timeline**: 6 weeks
**Decision point**: Go/No-Go for build phase

| Role | Commitment | Dayrate | Responsibility |
|------|------------|----------|-------------| 
| Account management | 2 days/week | PH | Stakeholder alignment |
| Product lead| 6 days | €560 | Product vision & roadmap |
| Design | 2.5 days | €560 | UI/UX & branding assets |
| Development | 6 days | €720 |Tech architecture |
| Project management | 4 days | €640 | Coordination |
| Quality control | 1 day/week | PH | Testing & validation |
| Total | | | €11640 |

#### Notes

- Dayrate rate is based on regular working hours of maximum 8 hours per day, excluding unforeseen costs such as for travel & accommodation, in case deemed necessary
- Excluding PH contribution

### Roles & Responsibilities

**Pinehurst Studio (Client Management):**  Relationship management, Oversight & validation
**Rizom (Product & Talent):** Product strategy, design, strategic oversight, development, sales & PM — with the flexibility to add or reconfigure roles based on Baiwin’s evolving priorities


## Why Rizom?

**Risk-free scaling:** outcome-based project before committing big
**Agile by design:** shift resources, skills, and focus as discoveries unfold
**Faster to market:** from prototype to MVP to traction in 4 lean cycles
**Win–win incentives:** success tied directly to validated results
