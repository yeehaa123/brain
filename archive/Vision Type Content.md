# Unlocking Collective Intelligence

## Seamlessly Connecting Expertise, Insights, and Learning Across and Beyond Your Organization


---

## Problem

Fortune 500 companies lose roughly $31.5 billion a year by failing to share knowledge effectively. 


---

## Challenge

Companies struggle to efficiently share complex, specialized knowledge, resulting in:

* Knowledge Bottlenecks
* Limited Scalability
* Slow Onboarding
* Stunted Innovation
* Reduced Customer Success
* Inefficient Learning

These challenges extend beyond individual companies, affecting our ability to address complex global issues and adapt to rapidly evolving work paradigms.


---

## Impact

This problem has much broader societal implications,  since it does not just affect large corporations.  Innovative organizations, networks, and ecosystems of all sizes face similar challenges:

* Siloed information across departments
* Experts overwhelmed with repetitive questions
* New hires struggle to find relevant information
* Valuable insights lost as employees leave
* Time wasted searching for up-to-date information
* Decisions made without access to all available knowledge
* Global knowledge disparities limiting collaborative problem-solving on critical issues

## The Idea: Just-In-Time Knowledge Sharing

An innovative approach that provides information exactly when it is needed, breaking down complex topics into easily digestible units. This method delivers relevant knowledge at the point of need, making it essential in modern workplaces where rapid access to information is crucial.

### Key Features:

* **Bite-sized and Actionable**: Information is divided into focused, easily consumable modules that provide clear, immediate steps for implementation or problem-solving.
* **Composable and Collaborative**: Knowledge units can be flexibly combined and rearranged to suit various needs. Content is created and refined through team collaboration, leveraging collective expertise.
* **Linked and Integrated**: By utilizing links, any relevant information from the internet can be seamlessly incorporated, expanding the knowledge base and keeping it current and comprehensive.

## How: Course Cards

Course cards are the fundamental units of the Just-In-Time Knowledge Sharing method. These cards are structured lists of tasks designed to work towards a specific goal or learning objective. They encapsulate bite-sized, actionable knowledge that can be quickly accessed and applied.

### Key Features:

* **Checkable**: Course cards contain of checkpoints. They are basically to-do list for your learning, but with a twist. Sometimes the to-do's can be checked by others for peer-review, tests, certification, etc *visualization: card with checkable tasks*
* **Bookmarkable**: Courses that you like but are created by other curators can be bookmarked and added to your personal collection 

  *visualization: card with the star button and that is 'transported' in a collection of cards*
* **Forkable**: Cards curated by other people can be forked and edited with the click of a button

  *visualization: card with a fork button, new card on the right with a different curator and a slightly different list of tasks*
* **Embeddable**: Course cards can be easily integrated into various digital platforms, learning management systems, or workflow tools. (Visualization: card embedded in other platforms such as LI)
* **Shareable**: Cards are designed for easy distribution among team members, departments, or even across organizations. 
  *visualization: share sheet as overlay on the card, like on mobile phones. So all the major social providers etc.*
* **Composable**: Individual cards can be combined and rearranged to create custom learning paths or comprehensive knowledge bases. 

  *visualization: A card which tasks consist of other cards. So one card in the middle and lines that connect each task to another card with the title of the task*

## How: Knowledge Vault

The Knowledge Vault is a cornerstone feature of our Just-In-Time Knowledge Sharing system, providing each user with a secure, personal database for managing their knowledge assets.

### Key Features:

* **Secure Personal Storage**: Private, encrypted database for storing course cards, notes, resources, and personal insights.
* **Smart Sharing and Collaboration**: Easy sharing of specific items with granular control over shared content.
* **Version Control**: Track knowledge evolution over time with the ability to revert to previous versions.

*These three features don't need to be visualized directly - just icons and explanation*

## How: Personal Development Coach

The course cards enable a powerful new feature: the Personal Development Coach. This AI-driven tool leverages the modular, actionable nature of course cards to provide personalized guidance for individual growth and learning.

### Key Features:

* **Personalized Learning Paths**: Creates custom sequences of course cards, tailoring the learning journey to each individual's needs and aspirations. 

  *visualization*: trello like board but now showing the next cards that the PDC recommends in succession
* **Proactive Skill Development**: Identifies potential skill gaps and offers just-in-time interventions. *visualization*: spider graph with learned skills, hovering over the skills gives the user a list of recommended courses
* **Collaborative Learning Ecosystem**: Fosters a collaborative learning environment by recommending valuable cards and facilitating knowledge sharing. 

  *visualization*: notification sidebar with courses recommended by your network: company, interests groups, company, etc

## Track Record: Measuring Collective Intelligence

Our proprietary 'Track Record' metric, based on Transactive Memory Systems (TMS):

* **Scientific Foundation**: Rooted in cognitive and organizational psychology research on group knowledge dynamics
* **Holistic Measurement**: Assesses not just individual knowledge, but team awareness and access to shared expertise
* **Performance Indicator**: Tracks improvements in knowledge sharing and collaboration over time
* **Business Impact**: Correlates with key organizational outcomes like innovation speed and decision-making efficiency
* **Competitive Edge**: Unique to our system, offering unparalleled insights into your organization's knowledge ecosystem
* **Societal Impact**: Assesses contributions to broader knowledge ecosystems and global problem-solving initiatives
