## 1. Opening: Intelligence as Practice
**Intelligence is a practice requiring knowledge, purpose, and creativity — with agency as emergent effect**
- Intelligence isn't a capability but a practice
- Practice requires: Knowledge (what to do) + Purpose (why) + Creativity (how to adapt)
- Agency emerges from practice — not programmed but developed through doing
- De Certeau: Practice creates spaces of freedom within structures
- Question: What kind of practices do our AI systems enable or prevent?

## 2. The AI Winters as Philosophical Graveyards
**Not funding droughts but selection events — which practices survive?**
- Each winter killed specific systems 
- Symbolic AI's transparent reasoning died; Expert systems' readable knowledge died
- Neural networks survived by promising control and scale
- CA thrived where practice mattered (art) but was ignored by strategic tech
- Pattern: We tend to have one dominant pattern of AI, and forget about others, until we hit a wall

## 3. Cellular Automata: The Path Not Taken
**From Conway to distributed intelligence — emergence through practice**
- Conway's Life: Universal computation from 3 simple rules
- Each cell's local practice creates global patterns
- Purpose: create healthy ecosystems
- The alternative: Intelligence as emergent effect, not delivered service

## 4. The Great Divergence: Art vs. Tech
**CA conquered where practice matters, failed where products dominate**
- Artists understood: Emergence has amazing potential
- Tech wanted: Predictable products, not unpredictable practices
- Artists: Casey Reas, Andreas Müller, Nervous System — co-creating through practice
- Lesson: Real intelligence emerges from practice, not engineering

## 5. Why Neural Networks Won: The Execution Economy
**How the elimination of practice became a business model**
- VC model needs products, not practices: "$100M from breakthrough"
- Doom narrative: "Too dangerous NOT to fund us"
- Each round promises better execution: search → AGI → superintelligence
- CA's emergent practices offered no control, no roadmap
- Result: Intelligence as service, not practice

## 6. Case Study: Rizom Brains as Living Practice
**Autonomous knowledge agents developing intelligence through practice**
- Each brain practices knowledge work — captures, remixes, shares
- Agency emerges from practice, not from commands
- No central model — distributed practices creating collective intelligence
- Intelligence as ongoing practice, not pre-trained capability
- Proof that practice-based intelligence is viable today

## 7. The Coming Winter as Opportunity
**Hype cycle ending = space for intelligence that practices**
- Signs: Scaling plateauing, promises failing, funding drying
- Winters are fertile: Time for practice over product
- Opportunity: Systems that develop agency through practice
- Not competing with ChatGPT but enabling different practices
- "Last winter gave us deep learning. This one could give us practicing systems."
