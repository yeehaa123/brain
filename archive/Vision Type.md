## What is a vision type?

A prototype that is meant to show a persuasive story of a possible future


## Story 

*Like the ‘Brand story’, but for the product and much more specific and concrete*



1. **The idea**: **Known problem & ideas for solution. Ambiguous or competing visions.**

→ Methods and tools that make knowledge bite-sized, composable, an shareable



2. **The story**: **Protagonist. Conflict. Rising action. Resolution.**

→ **Protagonist**: A leader of a mid-sized organization with strong culture and values that is heavily involved in talent acquisition and training.  

\-> **Conflict:** Organization can no longer scale because the knowledge is passed on from person to person (each one, teach one) without a external knowledge base.

→ **Rising Action:** Offcourse is introduced and allows the organic, gradual creation of the above mentioned knowledge base.

→ **Resolution:** Organization is now global without losing culture and values.



3. **The pieces: Unify existing pieces. Don’t sweat the small stuff.** *& pull the pieces together (screens and diagrams)*

Unique key features (What makes us different)

→ Embedable cards (meet users where they are)

→ Link-based (the whole internet can be integrated)

→ Each user has their own personal DB that they control (no privacy and surveillance concerns)

→ Each user has full control over what they data and content they choose to publish and what they subscribe to

→ Offcourse can be integrated into your own environments on different levels (api, widgets, platform)

→ Personal dashboard for recommendations, insights and, goal setting

→ Compatible with industry standard LMS (learning managements system) and LRS (learning record store) solutions through the experience API (xAPI)

→ Interactive



4. **The leap of faith: Push what’s possible. Dream big.** *Share at least 1 constraint that we should push past to make the vision better*

→  


*Build*

*Validate high-level concept*



5. **The key people: Allies, Challengers, Influencers. Forebearers.** *Here we show feedback from users based on the validated high-level concept*

6. **The artifacts. Enable others to promote this vision, now or in the future** *(for example: keynote prototype, Figma clickable prototype, animation, pdf prototype, etc).*

→ 


## Vision type (TBD)
