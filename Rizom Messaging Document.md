**Who are we?** 

Creative pioneers reshaping the rules of work by introducing play.

A group providing the sandbox where play is not just encouraged, it is vital to success.

**What are we?**


A movement rewriting the rules of work. 

A group who realises the organisational, cultural and societal cost of siloed information and the unexplored potential to democratize knowledge and expertise.

We provide the playground for innovation to thrive and the platform to share organisational knowledge.

We do this through a new kind of ecosystem architecture that fosters and utilises the collective spirit of innovation.

We catalyse a culture of shared learning and accelerate innovation. 

We transform how organizations manage, leverage, and grow their intellectual capital.

We build workplace ecosystems that thrive on innovation and interconnectedness.

We give people within organizations more control over their resources and decision-making processes, empowering them to collaboratively create better workplaces.



**Why do we do it?**


Because the future of work is play.

Because organisations need to upend outdated practices stifling innovation and knowledge transfer and revolutionise the way they work.

Democratic knowledge transfer and play will have a catalytic effect rippling through all aspects of an organization. 

They will make organizations more effective, better organised, better able to utilize unrealized talent, purpose and value-driven.

Information within organisations needs to be better dispersed and exchanged between its workers. 

The talents and ideas of people within organisations need to be better heard, seen and utilised. 

The automation of routine tasks within organisations provides workers with unrealised potential: the ability to create, explore and collaboratively problem-solve.

Value-driven, innovation-first organisations of the future will foster and encourage play as a crucial element to their success, breaking free from archaic and hierarchical models that stunted innovation and thwarted the abilities of its own people.

These organisations will prioritise play.

Play births ideas, encourages freedom of expression, explores innovative solutions and challenges redundant practices. 

Mediated and moderated play provides the sandbox for change.

Without play - without uninhibited exploration and creative problem solving - organisations suffer. 



**What do we stand for?** 

Transforming the future of work.

Building transparent, collaborative communities. 

Sharing knowledge transparently. 

Breaking free from outdated practices and creating environments where work naturally flows into play, leading to both innovation and fulfillment.

A culture of shared learning and continuous improvement.

Creating a palette of possible alternatives.

Collaboration is key.

Organizations should encourage their members to imagine, design, and build new, even better spaces.


**How do we do it?**

Our professional collective of experts in digital transformation, organizational development, and ecosystem design provides the playground for innovation.

Under a shared ownership model, we transcend traditional consulting structures by fostering genuine stakeholder engagement through equitable participation and distributed decision-making.

We provide the sandbox and the lego bricks for organisations to build the way they work and their own collaboration hub. 

We transform expert knowledge from a bottleneck into an accessible resource
We build organizations bound by shared knowledge, mutual trust and purpose.
We facilitate cross-pollination of ideas, connecting disparate knowledge nodes to uncover hidden insights and opportunities within the ecosystem.
We quantify collective intelligence and identify cognitive gaps, allowing organizations to optimize their learning pathways and decision-making processes.



**Why do we believe in it?** 

Because knowledge, expertise and innovation should be distributed and made available to all.

Because decentralised creative and equitable solutions can and should steer our way forward to a better future.
Because we need to imagine, shape, and perform better alternatives.

Innovation should enhance both people and planet, transform education, environmental practices, and social equity.

Because communities of the future should be interconnected by shared knowledge and resources. They should be inclusive and empowering. 

Beause power elites should not be able to exploit the knowledge, talent and infrastructures of the public for their own personal gain. 

True innovation is about fostering a culture of creativity and problem-solving that permeates every aspect of an organization or community.

We should invest in futures that we want to inhabit, rather than settling for the one we expect to become reality.
