## 1. Business Model & Pain Points

### Proposition

Rizom transforms how organizations share knowledge by combining expert talent, proven methodology, and playful technology - helping you grow without losing your culture or getting stuck in meetings.

### Pain Points We Solve

#### Organizations

During the growth phase, most collectives (organization, networks, ecosystems)  go through a similar trajectory. In the early stages, they evolve smoothly and organically until a certain critical mass has been realized. 

After that bottlenecks start to appears, the most common ones are:

* Dependence on certain key people (f.i. founders)
* Perceived need to be physically present in the office
* Coordination issues between departments
* Abundance of regular and ad-hoc meetings
* Over-reliance on tools and procedures

The common cause of all these bottleneck is insufficient access to trusted shared knowledge. Rizom helps collectives to overcome this bottleneck by providing methods, tools, and services to manage shared knowledge.

#### Professionals

Current professionals are caught between a rock and a hard place. They either have to chose the secure but constrained path of a regular job, or they have to walk the free but risky path of self-employment. The gig economy and its corresponding platforms promised a third option between these two extremes, but offered the worst of both world: meaning it combined the constraints of a regular job with the risks of self-employment.

***Employees****:*

* Rigid work schedules
* Limited career growth
* Fixed salary constraints

***Freelancers****:*

Unstable freelance income

Self-managed benefits

Unpaid administrative work

***Common****:*

Poor work-life balance

Constant skill pressure

Professional isolation

Boundary setting challenges

Lacking meaningful purpose

The common cause of all these pain points is an unsustainable risk/reward distribution between companies and professionals. Rizom helps collectives to overcome this bottleneck by a fair shared compensation and ownership model. This model is based on contributed value rather than mere time/revenue.
