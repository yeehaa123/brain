Interesting pivot from property research to ecosystem design. Let me think through this honestly.

## The Case For

**Timing signals:**

- Property still affordable before MRT completion drives prices up
- Aging craftspeople = knowledge about to be lost = urgency
- Taiwan government actively supports craft/cultural industries (文創)
- New Taipei Museum of Art nearby adds cultural infrastructure
- “Made in Taiwan” ceramics could ride the same reshoring/provenance wave as other manufacturing

**Yingge-specific assets:**

- Brand recognition across Asia
- Existing supply chain fragments (glazes, kilns, materials suppliers)
- Tourism foot traffic for retail/showcase component
- Ceramics museum as potential institutional partner

## The Hard Questions

**1. What does “forward-looking ceramics” actually mean?**

This needs sharp definition. Possibilities:

- **Computational ceramics** - 3D printing, parametric design, CNC
- **Functional ceramics** - technical/industrial applications (actually Taiwan has strength here - think semiconductor components, not just teapots)
- **Sustainable materials** - circular economy, local clay sourcing, low-fire techniques
- **Craft + digital** - NFTs of designs, on-demand production, mass customization
- **Cross-sector** - ceramics × architecture, × food service, × wellness/tea culture

Each of these implies a very different community, business model, and space design.

**2. Who actually shows up?**

The coworking/incubator model needs bodies. Potential constituencies:

- Young designers priced out of Taipei studios
- Technical ceramicists doing R&D
- International artists-in-residence
- Food/hospitality startups needing custom wares
- Architecture firms exploring ceramic facades
- Academic researchers

But are these people currently going to Yingge? Or would you need to pull them there?

**3. The Gouda warning**

Gouda’s ceramics industry didn’t reinvent itself - it became heritage tourism while production moved to Drenthe and eventually abroad. The craft knowledge calcified into museum exhibits rather than living practice. Is there a counter-example of a craft cluster that successfully transitioned to innovation hub?

Possible models:

- **Jingdezhen, China** - has tried the “ceramics innovation” angle with mixed results, mostly still traditional production + artist residencies
- **Stoke-on-Trent, UK** - attempted reinvention, largely failed
- **Seto/Arita, Japan** - interesting hybrid of tradition + contemporary design collaborations

**4. Physical vs. distributed**

Given your work with Rizom on distributed collaboration, is a physical space actually the right model? Or would a network that connects Yingge craftspeople with designers/clients globally be more aligned with your thesis about decentralized work?

A hybrid might work: minimal physical presence (shared kiln access, materials library, showroom) + distributed network for design/business development.

## What Would Make It Work

If I were stress-testing this:

1. **Anchor tenant or institutional partner** - the ceramics museum, a university program, or a major brand doing production there
2. **Clear wedge** - not “ceramics generally” but a specific niche (e.g., “ceramic components for architecture” or “tea ware for specialty coffee/tea”)
3. **International connection** - residency exchange with Jingdezhen, Mashiko, European design schools
4. **Revenue model beyond rent** - because coworking margins are brutal; probably needs production facilities, retail, education components

## Honest Assessment

The ingredients exist. But “coworking for ceramics” is a concept that sounds good and could easily become a subsidized art space that never reaches sustainability. The question is whether there’s a genuine economic engine underneath.

What’s drawing you to this specifically? Is it the Rizom model applied to physical craft, or something else?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
