## Overview
This framework provides a structured approach for rapidly evaluating potential agency acquisition targets using weighted criteria across two key dimensions: Strategic Value and Turnaround Potential. The assessment is designed to be completed in 2-3 hours using readily available information, resulting in a clear positioning on the Quick-Scan Matrix.

| S3 | **Access to Strategic Markets**: Does their location provide access to new strategic markets for Rizom? | 15% | | |
| S4 | **Gap-Filling Expertise**: Do they have specialized expertise that fills a gap in Rizom's current capabilities? | 20% | | |

## Assessment Process

### Step 1: Data Gathering
Collect information from:
- Agency website and portfolio
- Social media presence and activity
- Industry databases and directories
- Professional networks and contacts
- Public financial information (if available)
- Initial conversations with agency representatives

### Step 2: Scoring
- Score each question on a 1-5 scale using the scoring guides
- Multiply each score by the question weight
- Sum the weighted scores for each axis
- Final scores will range from 1-5 for each axis

### Step 3: Matrix Placement
Plot the agency on the Quick-Scan Matrix using the calculated scores:
- X-axis: Strategic Value score
- Y-axis: Turnaround Potential score

### Step 4: Interpretation

**Priority Targets** (High Strategic Value, High Turnaround Potential)
- Strategic Value: 3.5-5.0
- Turnaround Potential: 3.5-5.0
- Action: Proceed to comprehensive assessment and prioritize for acquisition

**Value Opportunities** (Lower Strategic Value, High Turnaround Potential)
- Strategic Value: 1.0-3.4
- Turnaround Potential: 3.5-5.0
- Action: Consider opportunistic acquisition if terms are favorable

**Strategic Partnerships** (High Strategic Value, Lower Turnaround Potential)
- Strategic Value: 3.5-5.0
- Turnaround Potential: 1.0-3.4
- Action: Explore alternative structures (partnerships, JVs, staged acquisition)

**Avoid** (Lower Strategic Value, Lower Turnaround Potential)
- Strategic Value: 1.0-3.4
- Turnaround Potential: 1.0-3.4
- Action: Remove from consideration
