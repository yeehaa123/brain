# Recall

## Executive Summary

Every growing team faces the same bottleneck: critical knowledge gets trapped in key people's heads and scattered across tools. Projects stall when experts aren't available. Context disappears when people leave. New hires spend weeks hunting for information that should be at their fingertips.

Recall by Rizom transforms your existing workplace conversations—Slack threads, Notion docs, GitHub discussions—into an intelligent, searchable knowledge system. Instead of hunting through channels or waiting for the right person to respond, your team gets instant answers through an internal AI assistant that knows your business.

The result: new hires onboard in days not months, decisions move faster, and your team's collective intelligence becomes accessible to everyone, not just a few gatekeepers.


## The Problem 

Knowledge in growing teams gets trapped in two places: a few key people's heads, and a maze of scattered tools.

### The symptoms are familiar:

- Teams have unofficial "go-to people" who become bottlenecks for decisions
- Important context lives buried in old Slack threads, forgotten docs, and private AI chats
- New hires ask the same questions repeatedly, interrupting busy teammates
- When domain experts are unavailable or leave, projects grind to a halt

### The deeper issue: 

As teams adopt more tools—Slack, Notion, GitHub, ChatGPT, Zoom recordings—knowledge becomes more fragmented, not less. You end up with a dozen places to search and no single source of truth.

### This creates three critical risks:

1. Decision bottlenecks when only certain people have context
2. Limited team scalability because knowledge doesn't transfer
3. Concentrated risk around key individuals who become irreplaceable


## The Solution 

Instead of trying to change how your team works, Recall makes your existing conversations intelligent.

### The core insight: 

Your team already documents everything—in Slack discussions, Notion pages, GitHub issues, even AI chat logs. But this knowledge lives in silos. Recall connects the dots, turning scattered conversations into a unified intelligence layer.

### How it works in practice:

- Instant answers via an internal AI assistant that understands your business context, terminology, and decisions
- Living documentation that updates automatically as your team's knowledge evolves  
- Connected insights that link related discussions across tools and time
- Smart onboarding that gets new hires up to speed without interrupting your team
- Team intelligence coaching that identifies knowledge gaps, dependencies, and sharing opportunities

### What makes it different:

- Cross-platform intelligence works with your existing tools, doesn't replace them
- Self-hosted and private means your knowledge stays on your infrastructure
- Context-aware understanding of your business, not just generic information

The result: your team's collective knowledge becomes as accessible as asking a colleague who happens to know everything.


## How It Works

### Setup 

Connect Recall to the tools where your team's knowledge lives - selected Slack channels, Notion spaces, GitHub repos, and key external sources. Everything stays private on your infrastructure.

### Continuous Learning

Recall quietly observes conversations and documentation, building a map of your team's knowledge - who knows what, how decisions evolve, what questions come up repeatedly.

### Instant Access

When someone needs information, they ask Recall directly (via Slack, web, or API) and get contextual answers drawn from your team's collective knowledge, not generic training data.

### Team Optimization

Recall surfaces insights about knowledge patterns - highlighting dependencies, suggesting documentation priorities, and identifying opportunities for knowledge sharing before they become bottlenecks.


## Why Now?

Three converging trends make this the right moment for intelligent knowledge infrastructure:

### Tool proliferation has reached a breaking point

Teams now juggle Slack, Notion, GitHub, ChatGPT, Zoom recordings, and more. Instead of simplifying knowledge work, each new tool creates another silo. The promise of "connected workspace" remains unfulfilled.

### AI finally understands context, not just content

Modern AI can grasp the nuances of how your team thinks, decides, and communicates - turning scattered conversations into coherent knowledge graphs that preserve meaning and relationships.

### Remote-first teams need shared intelligence

When everyone worked in the same office, knowledge transferred through hallway conversations. Now that informal knowledge sharing needs to be rebuilt intentionally, at scale.

Unlike vendor-specific AI features that lock you into single platforms, Recall works as neutral infrastructure - connecting your existing tools while keeping your data under your control.


## Business Model

Rizom operates as a certified partner network, scaling through independent implementation specialists who handle the deep customization of Recall that knowledge-intensive organizations require.

### Revenue Structure

- Platform licensing fees from partners based on deployed implementations
- Revenue sharing model: partners retain implementation and ongoing service fees
- Tiered certification levels with corresponding platform access and support

### Partner Value Proposition

- Access to cutting-edge knowledge infrastructure platform
- Comprehensive certification and ongoing training program
- Technical support and platform development roadmap input
- Exclusive territory/vertical opportunities for top-performing partners
- White-label options for established consultancies

### Why This Model Works

Partners bring domain expertise, existing client relationships, and implementation capacity while we focus on core product development and platform innovation. This creates highly satisfied customers through deep, bespoke implementations with significantly lower capital requirements than direct sales to reach enterprise markets.

### Target State

Network of 15-25 certified partners across key markets, focusing on knowledge-intensive sectors: consulting, engineering, product development, and research organizations.


## Go-To-Market Approach

### Phase 1 — Prove Value Through Partners (Months 1-6)

#### Partner Recruitment

Identify and recruit 2-3 independent professionals from our existing network with strong relationships in knowledge-intensive teams: product/engineering, consulting, customer success.

#### Joint Development

Co-develop initial implementations hands-on, building certification methodology through real client work. Focus on tightly scoped pilots with clear KPIs:
- Time to find answers (target: 50% reduction)
- Reduction in "ask X" messages (target: 30% fewer interrupts)  
- Onboarding time for new hires (target: 2x faster ramp-up)

#### Success Criteria

Create 3-5 deeply satisfied ambassador customers with measurable ROI stories and documented best practices for replication.

### Phase 2 — Scale Partner Network (Months 6-18)

#### Certification Program Launch

Build formal certification based on Phase 1 learnings, including both technical implementation and client management requirements.

#### Partner Expansion

Recruit additional partners targeting 10-15 total across key markets, prioritizing those with existing AI implementation or organizational change expertise.

#### Market Positioning

Partners position Recall as essential infrastructure: an internal knowledge OS over existing toolstack, risk mitigation for key-person dependency, and productivity multiplier for distributed teams.

#### Expansion Strategy

Start implementations in single business units, then expand horizontally based on demonstrated value. Partners handle relationship expansion while we provide technical scaling support.

### Phase 3 — Hybrid Model Evolution (Months 18+)

#### Platform Maturation

Layer in self-service options for simpler implementations while maintaining partner channel for complex, high-value deployments.

#### Direct Market Entry

Begin selective direct engagement with strategic enterprise accounts while preserving partner relationships and territory agreements.


## Key Risks & Mitigations

### Too abstract/theoretical

Partners always lead with concrete, relatable problems ("How long did it take to find X last week?") and demo specific use cases rather than explaining knowledge management concepts. Every conversation starts with the prospect's actual pain points.

### Employee resistance/surveillance concerns

Partners position as team assistant, not monitoring. Clear opt-in channel controls and privacy boundaries. Implementation includes change management expertise.

### Partner execution quality

Co-develop first implementations hands-on. Certification program includes both technical and client management requirements. Ongoing partner support and quality audits.

### Competition from platform vendors (Microsoft, Slack, etc.)

Partners emphasize cross-tool neutrality and self-hosted deployment as core differentiators. Focus on deep, custom knowledge graphs vs. generic AI features.

### Partner dependency/channel conflict

Build direct SaaS capability in parallel. Partner agreements include knowledge transfer requirements. Maintain option to go direct for strategic accounts.
