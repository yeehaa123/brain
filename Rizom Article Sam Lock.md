Imagine working on your dream project where you can outsource what you don’t want with the freedom to focus on what matters. 

You log on to access a world-class talent pool where the tools and infrastructure are already there to team up on purpose-driven projects. 

Here, there’s power in numbers: a pool of talent to choose from and a steady pipeline of clients looking for their next hire. 

It’s the hierarchy of traditional freelancing turned on its head.

A talent collective that combines the agility of freelancing with the structure and stability of formal employment.

Welcome to the world of Rizom. 

“We arrange the contracts, we arrange the tools, we arrange the people and you choose how you want to work,” explains founder Jan Hein Hoogstad. 

“We're a one stop shop for entrepreneurship.” 

The threshold for being your own boss suddenly became a lot lower. 

Rizom is the first talent collective to give its members access to top tier accredited professionals for a fraction of the cost without a months-long hiring process or long-term commitment.

And it gives those looking for work a choice of clients and projects as well as location and lifestyle flexibility. 

But for Hoogstad it’s more than a transactional platform. It’s a shared knowledge ecosystem.

Members are active co-creators of a system designed to benefit from their collective intelligence, bypassing the bureaucracy of a traditional organizational structure.  

“We already have a new paradigm; we just don't use our resources,” the Dutch but Taiwan-based programmer and ecosystem architect says.

“We no longer need to settle for a one-size-fits-all model of the future.”

For the past year Hoogstad has been working on a better solution. 

“The freelance economy is as if we are still hunter gatherers when farming was already invented,” he explains.

“We could acquire food together collectively but we still choose to go out and hunt dinosaurs individually at night.”

“Rizom gives you the sandbox complete with all the lego bricks you need to build the way you want to work.”

Hoogstad also takes a leaf from nature. 

Ecosystems collaborate, they don’t compete.

And it’s where the name comes from - rhizomes - plant systems that thrive through connection, knowledge sharing, and adaptability.
