**Are you looking for a cofounder?**

While I am not currently seeking co-founders, Rizom is actively sourcing a founding team from the talented experts within our collective and beyond.

Our focus is on building a dynamic, collaborative ecosystem where independent experts can come together to tackle complex challenges. We value autonomy and independence, but also recognize the power of collective intelligence.

Rather than looking for traditional co-founders, we are assembling a diverse founding team that can leverage their individual expertise while aligning around our shared vision and goals.

A decentralized professional ecosystem of human and non-human agents

**What is your company going to make? Please describe your product and what it does or will do.**

Rizom is building a decentralized ecosystem that empowers independent professionals to collaborate and scale their expertise. At the heart of this ecosystem are AI agents called "connectors" that act as personal assistants, handling administrative tasks, sourcing talent, and coordinating projects. The Rizom Collaborator is a key connector that facilitates seamless teamwork between independent experts, allowing them to share knowledge, delegate work, and maintain control over their unique approaches. Together, these AI connectors create a flexible, autonomous platform that enables professionals to build successful, scalable businesses without sacrificing their independence.

**How far along are you?**

Rizom is in the early growth phase, having developed an initial non-technical product proposition, developed a technical PoC, and onboarded an active user base of around 30 people. However we are still iterating and expanding its capabilities. More investment in product development, user acquisition, and ecosystem growth will be needed to reach full maturity.
