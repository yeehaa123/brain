## About
I am an entrepreneur, thinker, and coder. Nowadays, I like to call myself an ecosystem architect. This means that I bring people together around common values, discover a shared vision, and translate this into effective ecosystems.

My greatest passion has always been changing the way people learn and challenging preconceived, ill-informed notions about education. With Offcourse, I aim to create an ecosystem of people and tools that focus on open and transparent knowledge sharing, instead of credentials, ego, and intellectual property.

In 2021, I created the Superconnectors event format, enabling startups to present their 'critical ask' to the best-connected people in the Dutch tech ecosystem.

I hold a PhD in Philosophy from the University of Utrecht and have worked as a researcher and teacher at several traditional (Utrecht, Berlin, Amsterdam, Minneapolis) and non-traditional (DevBootcamp San Francisco) schools. I also founded the Innovator's Working Group of the Dutch Internet Society and was actively involved in the Public Spaces Coalition. I strongly advocate for an impactful and inclusive internet.

I currently work and live in Taipei, Taiwan.
