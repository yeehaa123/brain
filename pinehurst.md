# Pinehurst x Rizom Collaboration 

## Executive Summary

Through a strategic partnership with Rizom, Pinehurst Studio will validate its business model, develop a blueprint for future digital transformation projects, and establish a scalable process for long-term growth.
Pinehurst is looking to find a repeatable business model to build out the foundation of their venture studio. Rizom will support Pinehurst to deliver the building blocks for scaling their client.

Rizom brings a flexible, venture-building model — adapting its resources, talent mix, and strategies to match Baiwin’s evolving needs, ensuring we pivot quickly when new insights emerge.

## The Opportunity

Many legacy businesses in Taiwan are lagging behind on their digital transformation. They are under pressure to survive and urgently need a transition to a sustainable digital model.
There is also an influx of returning migrants that are starting new business in Taiwan which are in need for repeatable business models. 

## The Solution

With this collaboration, Pinehurst and Rizom can:

1. Transform legacy businesess towards a digital solution in order to help them grow
2. Validate an e-commerce proof of concept before committing to further substantial investment
3. Reduce execution risk through Rizom’s iterative, pivot-ready approach
4. Flexibility to adjust scope, talent, and resources as opportunities and challenges surface
5. Deliver a potential repeatable playbook for future legacy-to-digital conversions
6. Build a solid foundation for future outcome-based projects


## Key risks:
- High upfront costs for digitization and e-commerce setup
- Limited in-house expertise for product, marketing, and tech development
- Uncertainty around customer acquisition and product–market fit

## Risk Mitigators

While the Pinehurst x Rizom collaboration targets high-impact digital transformation, it also recognizes the challenges inherent to modernizing legacy business models. To minimize exposure, the partnership employs an iterative, data-driven execution model that validates key assumptions before scaling.

Rizom’s flexible execution framework and Pinehurst’s strategic capital and governance oversight ensure a balanced risk profile. Each project phase—prototype, validation, and graduation—is designed to confirm feasibility, customer demand, and early traction before larger investments are made.

Key risk mitigators are:
- Use shared Pinehurst–Rizom resources to reduce initial outlay
- Deploy Rizom’s specialized in-house execution team to fill capability gaps
- Run rapid market experiments and data-driven GTM tests during validation
- Establish a joint governance model with clear roles, deliverables, and milestone reviews
- Begin with pilot initiatives that demonstrate quick wins

## Project Objectives

The project is designed to:

1. Validate Pinehurst’s venture studio model by testing a structured, outcome-based transformation project with Baiwin Collection
2. Develop a repeatable playbook for converting legacy businesses into digital-first ventures, to strengthen Pinehurst’s studio offering
3. Build and test a proof of concept (prototype → MVP → validated solution) that Pinehurst can use as a case study for future clients
3. Test and document customer acquisition strategies and product–market fit signals, giving Pinehurst data-driven evidence of what works in the Taiwan market
4. Capture intellectual property (processes, workflows, templates) that Pinehurst can reuse and scale across future portfolio companies
5. Validate the Pinehurst–Rizom collaboration model, ensuring Pinehurst can scale faster with a flexible, adaptive partner
6. De-risk future investments for Pinehurst by proving feasibility and market traction before committing significant capital


## Capital & Structure

(We add the info from the Pinehurts deck here: their proposed model, adding Rizom's lock-in for future projects. )

Pinehurst model bridges capital talent and execution. The Pinehurst model consits out of 4 stages:

1. Pre-Discovery Phase:
	•	Develop a high-level concept note outlining the market hypothesis, problem statement, and strategic opportunity.
	•	Execute a light Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to formalize the intent for joint validation and define initial roles, responsibilities, and funding assumptions.
	•	Assess early market signals and define success metrics for the Discovery phase.

2. Discovery Phase:
	•	Conduct problem and solution definition workshops with key stakeholders to clarify the customer pain points and potential value propositions.
	•	Design an early go-to-market (GTM) concept and customer validation plan.
	•	Identify measurable validation milestones and establish an initial risk and resource plan.

3. Validation Phase:
	•	Develop a functional prototype or service pilot to test market assumptions and operational feasibility.
	•	Launch initial customer acquisition activities to capture first revenue and traction signals.
	•	Use real-world data to refine the business model and inform investor readiness for scaling.

4. Graduation Phase:
	•	Upon successful validation, incorporate a new venture entity or SPV to formalize ownership and structure future growth.
	•	Secure term sheets from investors or internal funding commitments.
	•	Transition the project into a fully operational venture with a defined leadership team and growth roadmap.

Each venute runs a 6 months validation sprint. The partner structure looks as follow:
1. Founders/SME owners bring domain expertise and initial capital
2. Pinehurst + Rizom bring GTM expertise, product, operations and investor network

The Pinehurst capital structure is build up based on a co-funded structure. 35% is founder capital in cash or sweat equity to ensure alignment. 35% studio capital matched resources from Pinehurst and Rizom. 30% eternal raise from early investors / angel syndicate. 

## Partner SLA

This Agreement establishes a strategic partnership between Pinehurst and Rizom to jointly design, validate, and scale venture projects, beginning with the transformation initiative for Baiwin Collection. The collaboration aims to combine Pinehurst’s capital, network, and strategic leadership with Rizom’s operational, go-to-market, and product execution capabilities.

Pinehurst Studio:
