## Overview
This document outlines acquisition targets for Rizom's rollup strategy, focusing on boutique agencies in Europe (design, business development) and Asia (technology). Each target aligns with Rizom’s freelancer-driven model and offers strategic growth opportunities. Agencies are categorized into four quadrants:

1. **Priority Targets (High Strategic Value, High Turnaround Potential)** – Strong strategic fit with significant operational upside; top acquisition priorities.
2. **Value Opportunities (Lower Strategic Value, High Turnaround Potential)** – Distressed agencies that can be acquired cheaply and improved, though less strategically critical.
3. **Strategic Partnerships (High Strategic Value, Lower Turnaround Potential)** – Valuable agencies that may be too stable or expensive for acquisition but could provide strong partnership opportunities.
4. **Avoid (Lower Strategic Value, Lower Turnaround Potential)** – Agencies with minimal synergy or turnaround potential that should not be pursued.
