## 1. Opening: Intelligence as Practice, Not Product
**The fundamental misunderstanding that shapes our AI moment**

- **Core thesis**: Intelligence is agency — the active resistance to entropy through purposeful practice
- Not a capability to be delivered, but a process to be developed
- Practice = Knowledge (what) + Purpose (why) + Creativity (how to adapt)
- **Key insight**: Agency emerges from doing, not from being programmed
- Michel de Certeau: Practice creates spaces of freedom within imposed structures
- **Central question**: Are we building systems that practice intelligence, or systems that simulate it?

## 2. The Winters as Selection Events
**What lived, what died, and what this tells us about our values**

### First Winter (1974-1980): The Death of Learning
- **What died**: Perceptrons and bottom-up learning from experience
- **What survived**: Rule-based systems promising explicit control
- **Selection pressure**: Predictability over adaptability

### Second Winter (1987-1993): The Death of Transparency  
- **What died**: Expert systems and human-readable reasoning
- **What survived**: Statistical methods promising scalability
- **Selection pressure**: Performance over interpretability

### The Pattern
- Each winter selected *against* emergent practice
- Each winter selected *for* engineered control
- **Result**: Intelligence became a product to deliver, not a practice to cultivate

## 3. The Road Not Taken: Cellular Automata and Emergent Intelligence
**How artists understood what technologists missed**

### Conway's Game of Life as Intelligence Model
- Universal computation from three simple rules
- Local practice → global intelligence
- No central controller, no pre-programmed outcomes
- **Key insight**: Complexity emerges from simple, distributed practices
- **Demo**: [Interactive Game of Life](https://playgameoflife.com/) — watch intelligence emerge from practice

### Artists as Intelligence Theorists
- **[Casey Reas](http://reas.com/)** (Processing): Generative systems where code practices create art
- **[Ian Cheng](http://iancheng.com/)** ("Emissaries," BOB): Autonomous narratives that develop through practice
- **[Pierre Huyghe](https://www.mariangoodman.com/artists/pierre-huyghe)** ("After ALife Ahead"): Living ecosystems as intelligence models
- **[Hito Steyerl](https://www.davidzwirner.com/artists/hito-steyerl)** ("Power Plants"): Critical practice with/against AI systems
- **[Refik Anadol](https://refikanadol.com/)**: Data sculptures revealing emergent patterns in information

### Why Tech Ignored This Path
- CA offered practice, not product
- No controllable outcomes, no scalable business model
- VCs need predictable returns, not unpredictable emergence

## 4. How Neural Networks Conquered by Eliminating Practice
**The business model of intelligence-as-service**

### The Funding Machine
- Each AI winter created selection pressure for *product over practice*
- Neural networks won because they promised deliverable intelligence
- **Paradox**: Loss of interpretability became a feature, not a bug
- Black boxes enabled "magical" user experiences
- **The doom economy**: AI companies raise billions to protect us from the same systems they're building
- This isn't an accident — existential risk narratives are the engine of their funding cycle
- The more dangerous they claim their AI is, the more money they can raise to "align" it

### The Service Model
- Intelligence becomes something you consume, not something you do
- Users become passive recipients rather than active practitioners
- **Result**: Atrophy of human agency in favor of AI dependency
- The promise: "Don't think, just prompt"

### The Inflation Cycle
- Search → AGI → Superintelligence
- Each round promises better execution of the same paradigm
- **Missing**: Any vision of intelligence that practices

## 5. The Coming Winter as Creative Opportunity
**Why the next crash could birth practicing systems**

### Signs of the Winter
- Scaling laws plateauing despite massive investment
- Promise-reality gap widening (AGI perpetually "just around the corner")
- Energy and compute costs creating sustainability questions

### Why Winters are Fertile
- Removes pressure to deliver products immediately
- Creates space for experimental approaches
- **Historical pattern**: Major breakthroughs happen *during* winters, not booms

### Practicing Systems Emerging Now
- **Example**: Autonomous knowledge agents that develop understanding through interaction
- Systems that get smarter through doing, not just through training
- **Key difference**: These systems practice intelligence rather than execute it

## 6. Conclusion: The Choice Before Us
**Two futures for intelligence**

### Path 1: Intelligence as Optimized Service
- Faster, cheaper, more convenient AI products
- Human agency continues to atrophy
- Intelligence becomes increasingly centralized and controlled

### Path 2: Intelligence as Distributed Practice  
- Systems that develop agency through doing
- Humans and AIs as collaborative practitioners
- Intelligence becomes a shared, emergent property

### The Question That Matters
- Not "How do we build AGI?" but "What practices do we want to enable?"
- Not "How do we scale intelligence?" but "How do we cultivate it?"
- **Our choice now determines**: Whether AI augments human agency or replaces it

### Final Provocation
The next AI winter isn't a crisis to avoid — it's an opportunity to remember what intelligence actually is: the practice of creating meaning through purposeful resistance to chaos. The question is whether we'll use this opportunity to build systems that practice alongside us, or just better systems that practice for us.

**Speaking Notes:**
- Open with audience question: "What's the most intelligent thing you've done this week?" 
- Use Conway's Life demo/visualization during Section 3
- Reference current AI news/failures during Section 5
- End by asking audience to consider their own practices of intelligence
