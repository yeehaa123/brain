# Recall

## Executive Summary

Recall is an intelligent agent that captures knowledge from existing team communication and productivity tools, transforming it into a virtual catalyst for frictionless knowledge sharing. By automatically creating chatbots, topic registries, conversation summaries, and actionable feedback from collective team intelligence, Recall eliminates organizational dependency on individual "catalyst" employees and removes scaling constraints that limit company growth.

## Opportunity

Research consistently shows that knowledge sharing is essential for building productive, innovative teams. However, most organizations struggle to implement effective knowledge sharing practices that scale over time.

In practice, knowledge sharing revolves around individual employees we call "catalysts" - people who possess critical explicit and tacit knowledge about the organization. These catalysts share information, often informally and inconsistently, making them both invaluable assets and dangerous single points of failure. When a catalyst leaves, gets sick, or becomes unavailable, teams lose access to essential institutional knowledge.

This dependency creates several concrete problems:
- **Bottlenecks**: Teams wait for specific people to provide context or decisions
- **Knowledge hoarding**: Information stays siloed in individual minds
- **Scaling limits**: Growth becomes constrained by knowledge transfer capacity
- **Risk concentration**: Critical processes depend on individuals rather than systems

As long as organizational intelligence remains trapped in individual brains, companies face hard limits on their ability to scale effectively.

## Solution

Recall transforms teams into knowledge-sharing ecosystems by automatically capturing, organizing, and redistributing collective intelligence. The system integrates with existing tools where knowledge naturally flows:

- Communication platforms (Slack, Teams, Matrix)
- Documentation systems (Notion, Obsidian, GitHub)
- External content (company websites, social media, industry publications)
- AI interactions (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity conversations)

Recall uses intelligent agents to continuously monitor these sources, extract meaningful knowledge patterns, and transform raw information into structured, searchable intelligence.

**Knowledge Oracle**: Domain-specific chatbot integrated into all team communication tools, providing instant access to collective knowledge

**Topic Dictionary**: Comprehensive registry automatically cataloging important concepts, decisions, and discussions across the entire knowledge base

**Conversation Summaries**: Intelligent grouping and summarization of related discussions over time, creating coherent knowledge threads

**Team Coach**: Advanced feedback system using transactive memory methodology to identify knowledge gaps and collaboration opportunities

**Content Generation**: AI-powered drafting of blog posts, proposals, and communications based on your organization's unique knowledge base

Recall deploys as a private, self-hosted server (web, API, MCP protocol) that organizations can run on their own infrastructure, ensuring data privacy and control.

## Key Risks

**Market Risks:**
- Organizations may find the knowledge sharing problem too abstract to prioritize
- Employees might resist AI systems they perceive as replacement threats

**Technical Risks:**
- Major AI companies could launch competing centralized solutions
- Decentralized architecture might struggle to deliver seamless user experiences

**Adoption Risks:**
- Teams may actively sabotage systems they view as surveillance
- Integration complexity could slow deployment

## Risk Mitigators

**Prove Value Early**: Target independent professionals and small teams who will immediately experience competitive advantages from enhanced knowledge access

**Build Trust Through Transparency**: Develop and refine Recall within Rizom and close partner organizations, demonstrating real-world benefits before broader market launch

**Leverage Industry Advances**: Position Recall as "last-mile" knowledge infrastructure that benefits from improvements in foundation AI models rather than competing with them

**Emphasize Augmentation Over Replacement**: Frame Recall as amplifying human knowledge workers rather than replacing them, focusing on how it makes teams more effective

**Privacy-First Approach**: Self-hosted deployment addresses data sovereignty concerns that centralized solutions cannot match
