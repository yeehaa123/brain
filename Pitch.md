Rizom is the solution to talent waste

Our platform provides independent professionals tools to effectively work together and with clients

Our key differentiator is our proprietary methodology based on TMS

TMS states that teams and organizations function best when people optimally share knowledge with each other 

In practice, this knowledge sharing often revolves around so-called catalysts. People who possess critical knowledge for a team to function. 

This provides a huge liability, especially in sectors where employee retention is low.

Rizom offers both technical and non-technical tools to turn this risk into a opportunity 

**Technical**: 

- decentralized AI agents that augment and replace human catalyst with virtual ones

**Non-technical**: 

- ready made contracts that take the guess works out of client work and collaborations amongst independent professionals 
- community of like-minded professionals that gathers both online and offline

Rizom currently consists of 40 independent professions and operates globally

Our core team consist of:

Jan Hein Hoogstad: vision

Anand Briefjal: corporate development

Samantha Shao: Growth and community

Randy Daal: Technology and Talent
