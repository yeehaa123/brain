Strategy: Include network in building ecosystems and building rizom. The key beliefs, anecdotes and evidence/knowledge. *Challenge individually and cherish synergy.*

## Background

Jan Hein is a facilitator, ecosystem architect, entrepreneur, thinker, and coder with a PhD in Philosophy from the University of Utrecht. He brings a unique blend of academic rigor and practical innovation to his work, focusing on revolutionizing education and fostering open knowledge sharing. *Cutting corners to achieve more.*

## Key Principles (Rizom/Yeeha)

1. Focus on adoption - There is no ethics without users
2. Embrace existing solutions - Don't reinvent or compete with them
3. Align on shared, and even diverging, values - Do not obsess about the way they are implemented

## Values/Ethics

* Critical Thinker: Encourages questioning assumptions and thinking outside the box in both education and business
* Lifelong Learner and Teacher: Constantly evolving, from academia to tech entrepreneurship, embracing new challenges
* Open Knowledge Advocate: Focuses on transparent knowledge sharing over traditional credentials and intellectual property
* Ecosystem architect: Builds on synergy 

## Content Strategy

Create both high-effort (HE) and low-effort (LE) content matching key values

### Goals

* Create income and engagement models that:
  * Provide feedback - testing our assumptions

### Ecosystem Building Workshops

## Hypotheses to Test

* H0:  
  * Sugesstions?
    * H1: Lack of scalable knowledge transfer stops/delays a “founder mode leader” from scaling
    * H2: Scalable knowledge transfer tools is the highest priority of a company that is scaling.
    * H3: Creating a safe network (ecosystem) and partnerships will lead to more profitable business models 
    * H4: Talent will be attracted through our shared values and innovative solutions
    * 
      * Is irene our target market?
        * Why is she?
          * Is a leader / company in founder mode stuck?

          
* Create a timeline for implementing different aspects of the strategy
