• **Opening Hook**: What if AI had evolved differently? The dominant narrative vs. buried alternatives

• **The AI Winters**: Not just funding droughts but philosophical graveyards holding seeds of different futures

• **Lost Paradigms**: Symbolic AI, cybernetics, embodied cognition — abandoned approaches that promised transparency over opacity

• **Cellular Automata's Alternative Timeline**: From Conway to Wolfram — emergence from simple rules rather than massive datasets

• **Why Neural Networks Won**: The political economy of AI development and how power structures shaped our current reality

• **Distributed vs. Centralized Intelligence**: Local interactions creating global complexity vs. today's platform monopolies

• **Cellular Automata's Artistic Victory**: How it DID transform generative art — from demoscene to Processing, artists embraced emergence from simple rules

• **The Failed Tech Revolution**: Why cellular automata flourished in art but never shaped mainstream AI development — the disconnect between creative and commercial computation

• **Case Study: Rizom Brains**: Autonomous knowledge agents that communicate through simple protocols, creating emergent intelligence from local interactions — a living example of cellular automata principles applied to AI systems

• **The Coming Winter as Opportunity**: As the current AI hype cycle cools, we have a chance to step back from the dominant paradigm and cultivate alternative approaches — winters are when different seeds can finally grow
