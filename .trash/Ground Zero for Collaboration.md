A Fatality Event
1. Event Purpose
9/11 is a community networking event that challenges the idea that success must come from competition. Instead of simply exchanging business cards, participants leave with allies, collaborators, and practical solutions to real challenges. The event welcomes freelancers, business owners, professionals, and entrepreneurs who want to share experiences and build meaningful relationships.
2. Objectives
Bring together a small, diverse group of participants for authentic conversations
Provide a safe and open forum to share challenges that could hold back careers or businesses
Shift the mindset from competition to collaboration
Show participants how they can replicate the format in their own communities
3. Event Format
Duration: 2 hours
Group Size: 10-15 participants
Schedule (7:00–9:00 PM)
7:00 – 7:15 PM | Welcome and Context
Introduction to the 9/11 event and its purpose. Ground rules are set: confidentiality, respect, and no pitches. Icebreaker prompt: “What’s one unexpected challenge you’ve faced in your career or business?”


7:15 – 8:30 PM | Challenge Sharing
Participants each share one major career or business challenge (3-5 minutes each). After each share, the group offers insights, strategies, or connections (7–8 minutes). This pacing allows for deeper discussion and personal reflection.


8:30 – 8:45 PM | Building Allies
Participants write down who they want to connect with afterward. Encourage micro-commitments such as introductions, sharing resources, or arranging follow-up conversations.


8:45 – 9:00 PM | Closing Circle
Everyone shares one takeaway or action they plan to implement after the event. Closing reminder: “You’re leaving with allies, not just contacts.” Participants are invited to help host or co-host future sessions.
4. Materials and Setup
Venue: A small, cozy space with seating arranged in a circle to promote intimacy
Materials: Name tags, sticky notes or index cards for commitments, pens
Optional: Board or screen to display key prompts and reminders
Refreshments: Light snacks and drinks to encourage informal networking
5. Community Building Strategy
