## Executive Summary

Rizom will execute a targeted rollup strategy focusing on underperforming freelancer-based agencies in Europe (design, business development) and Asia (technology). This approach will accelerate collective growth, provide immediate revenue streams, and demonstrate the value of the Rizom organizational model while requiring less capital than traditional acquisitions. The strategy employs a structured assessment framework to efficiently identify and prioritize high-potential acquisition targets.


## Strategic Rationale

### Target Profile

- Agencies primarily operating with freelancer networks (70%+ freelancer workforce)
- Showing signs of financial or operational distress with fixable systemic issues
- Possessing valuable enterprise client relationships (highest priority)
- Strong freelancer networks with complementary specialized skills
- Located in strategic European and Asian markets
- Viable leadership transition potential

### Value Creation Mechanisms

1. **Apply Rizom's revenue distribution model** (60% Team, 25% INFRA, 15% Core) to create sustainable economics
2. **Implement Rizom infrastructure and methodology** to improve operational efficiency
3. **Cross-sell between acquired agency client bases** to increase utilization rates
4. **Transition agency leadership** into appropriate Rizom roles based on skills and alignment


## Acquisition Process

### Assessment Methodology

The acquisition process employs a two-stage assessment approach:

1. **Quick-Scan Matrix** - Initial 2-3 hour assessment plotting targets on Strategic Value vs. Turnaround Potential axes

2. **Comprehensive Canvas** - Detailed assessment for high-potential targets identified in the quick scan

### Identification Framework

1. **Network Intelligence**
   - Survey freelancers about struggling agencies
   - Join industry associations in target regions
   - Connect with agency-focused professional service providers

2. **Digital Footprint Analysis**
   - Monitor declining online presence and activity
   - Track job posting trends and staff turnover
   - Evaluate online reviews and ratings

3. **Financial Signal Monitoring**
   - Watch for office downsizing or remote transitions
   - Identify delayed payment patterns to freelancers
   - Track reduced participation in public tenders

4. **Regional Focus Areas**
   - Europe: Design communities, creative industry publications
   - Asia: Tech meetups, outsourcing platforms, regional business registries
