## What is Rizom?
Rizom is a decentralized professional ecosystem where talented individuals like you can combine your skills without sacrificing your unique style and approach. We're building an organic, resilient community inspired by rhizomes—plant systems that thrive through connection, knowledge sharing, and adaptability.

## How does Rizom work? 

We operate through three interconnected layers supported by a foundational infrastructure:

- **Community**: A network of ambassadors who share expertise, contribute to collective learning, and support our mission
- **Collective**: Members who collaborate on purpose-driven projects with fair compensation (60% of revenue goes directly to contributors)
- **Cores**: Owners who drive client acquisition, facilitate knowledge circulation, and shape Rizom's future
- **INFRA**: Our technological and methodological foundation that powers knowledge sharing and collaboration across the ecosystem

You can start as a community member and grow into collective and core roles as you engage more deeply with our knowledge ecosystem, all supported by INFRA's tools and frameworks.

## What makes Rizom different and what's in it for you?

Unlike traditional workplaces or freelance platforms, we're creating a genuine ecosystem where:

- Work feels like play—challenging, engaging, and aligned with your passions
- Knowledge sharing is fundamental—not just a nice-to-have feature but our core operating principle
- You can grow from community member to collective contributor to core owner
- Revenue distribution is transparent and generous (60% to team members)
- You maintain independence while accessing meaningful collaborations
- You'll work in pre-vetted empowered product teams, not as an isolated freelancer

As a Rizom collaborator, you'll benefit from:
- Access to a thriving ecosystem of like-minded professionals
- Opportunities to work on curated, purpose-driven projects
- Continuous learning through structured knowledge exchange
- The chance to vote on collective decisions as you grow with us
- Potential ownership and leadership opportunities

We're a band of "misfits"—creative, talented professionals who haven't found their place in traditional work environments. If you're an innovator who thrives on collaboration but values independence, Rizom might be your professional home.

## What kinds of projects does Rizom take on?

## What is INFRA and what role does it play?

INFRA is the technological and methodological foundation that powers the entire Rizom ecosystem. It serves multiple critical functions:

**Infrastructure Development**
- Creates and maintains the technological platforms and tools that enable seamless collaboration
- Develops and refines our Theory of Mind System (TMS) and knowledge amplification tools
- Ensures security, privacy, and ethical considerations in all our systems

**Knowledge Management**
- Designs frameworks and methodologies for capturing, organizing, and sharing knowledge
- Facilitates knowledge circulation between projects, teams, and members
- Creates AI-assisted workflows that enhance human capability rather than replacing it

**Ecosystem Enablement**
- Supports onboarding and integration of new members into the ecosystem
- Provides training and development resources for community growth
- Measures and optimizes ecosystem health and effectiveness

**Innovation Hub**
- Researches emerging collaboration methods and knowledge management approaches
- Tests and develops new tools that enhance collective intelligence
- Creates pathways for productizing successful methodologies

The 25% of project revenue allocated to INFRA ensures ongoing investment in these capabilities, creating a sustainable foundation that benefits everyone in the ecosystem. As INFRA develops new technologies and methodologies, they become available to all Rizom members, creating a virtuous cycle of innovation and value creation.

## How does Rizom's knowledge ecosystem work?

At the heart of our ecosystem is a unique approach to creating, sharing, and applying knowledge:

**Our Theory of Mind System (TMS)**
TMS is our proprietary framework that helps capture how individual minds work and collaborate. This system:
- Maps each member's unique thinking patterns, skills, and knowledge areas
- Identifies optimal collaboration patterns between different thinking styles
- Facilitates more effective team formation by matching complementary capabilities
- Creates personalized knowledge paths that align with your natural learning style

**Knowledge Amplification Tools**
Built on our TMS foundation, our collaboration tools help:
- Transform tacit knowledge (what you know but can't easily explain) into explicit, shareable insights
- Create AI-assisted workflows that enhance rather than replace human creativity
- Build collective intelligence that's greater than the sum of individual contributions
- Ensure insights from each project benefit the entire ecosystem

This integrated knowledge approach means you're not just joining a platform—you're becoming part of a living system that helps you access the right knowledge at the right time while amplifying your own unique expertise.

## How is revenue distributed?

For client projects, revenue is distributed as follows:

- 60% to the team working on the project (that could be you!)
- 25% to INFRA for maintaining our tools, knowledge infrastructure, and ecosystem development
- 15% to the Core that acquired and managed the client

This transparent model ensures you're fairly compensated for your contributions while supporting the infrastructure that makes our ecosystem possible. Unlike traditional platforms that take larger cuts with minimal reinvestment, INFRA's portion directly funds the development of tools and methodologies that increase the value and effectiveness of your work.

## What is your roadmap for growth?

We're working toward specific goals that create opportunities for collaborators:

- **Q3 2025**: 50 ambassadors, 10 collective members, 5 core strategists
- **Q1 2026**: 5,000 talents reached, 3 flagship projects delivered, financial sustainability achieved
- **2027**: Network of think tanks, 5 autonomous cells, 3 productized tools launched

As we grow, there will be increasing opportunities for collaboration, knowledge contribution, and leadership.

## How does Rizom welcome new members?

Our approach focuses on alignment, collaboration potential, and knowledge-sharing capacity rather than traditional credentials. As you engage with our ecosystem, you'll naturally find your place through participation in community activities, knowledge exchanges, and eventually client work—all at a pace that works for you and the collective.

Growth opportunities emerge organically as your contributions and connections within the ecosystem develop, with clear pathways from community to collective to core roles.

## How does the team-up process work?

Our team formation process combines natural collaboration with intelligent matching, all powered by continuous knowledge exchange:

**As a Web Designer, Here's How You Might Join a Project:**

1. **Discover Opportunities**: Browse available projects in our Matrix-based communication channels or through announcements from Core owners. You might see a digital transformation project for an educational institution requiring web experience design skills.

2. **Express Interest**: Signal your availability and interest in projects that match your skills and passions.

3. **Connect with Complementary Talent**: You'll be introduced to other professionals whose skills complement yours—perhaps a digital learning strategist, a UX researcher, and a front-end developer who are also interested in the project.

4. **Team Formation Session**: Participate in a facilitated session to define roles, responsibilities, and approach. Using our TMS-based tools, you'll identify how your web design expertise fits with the learning strategist's transformation plan and the developer's technical implementation.

5. **Knowledge Exchange**: As the team forms, you'll engage in structured knowledge sharing about the specific domain, client context, and relevant previous experiences from across the collective.

6. **Collaborative Workflow**: Once the team is formed, you'll work together using our collaboration tools. You maintain your creative independence while benefiting from the team's diverse perspectives and collective knowledge.

7. **Project Execution**: The Core owner provides oversight and client management, allowing you to focus on your craft while ensuring alignment with client expectations.

8. **Documentation and Learning**: Throughout the project, you'll contribute to shared knowledge assets that become valuable resources for the entire collective.

9. **Recognition and Compensation**: Upon project completion, you receive your share of revenue (part of the 60% allocated to contributors) based on your contribution, while building your reputation and knowledge portfolio for future opportunities.

**Natural vs. Curated Collaboration**

You can form teams in two ways:

- **Organic Collaboration**: Naturally connect with other members based on shared interests and complementary skills through our community channels, knowledge exchanges, and events
- **Guided Matching**: Benefit from our TMS-based algorithm that suggests optimal collaborators based on your work style, skills, knowledge areas, and past collaboration patterns

Once formed, your team operates as a true empowered product team—you'll have collective ownership of outcomes, authority to make key decisions, and the ability to innovate within the project scope. This empowerment creates more satisfying work experiences while delivering exceptional value to clients.

## How do decisions get made at Rizom?

Our governance model reflects our organic, decentralized approach:

- Community members can influence the collective through periodic input and knowledge contributions
- Collective members can vote on operational decisions and knowledge management practices
- Core owners actively determine Rizom's strategic direction and knowledge priorities

As you grow with us, your decision-making power increases organically.

## What support does Rizom provide to its members?

We provide:

- Curated connections to like-minded professionals
- Comprehensive knowledge management systems that capture and distribute insights
- Moderation of shared spaces to ensure productive collaboration
- Facilitation of personal development and continuous learning
- Tools and infrastructure for seamless collaboration
- Fair compensation and transparent revenue sharing
- Marketing and client acquisition (so you can focus on your craft)

## How does Rizom find clients?

Core owners take on entrepreneurial risk by focusing on client acquisition and account management. In return, they receive a portion of project revenue (15%). We're actively building our client base and welcome members who can bring potential projects.

## Can I join part-time or do I need to commit full-time?

Rizom is designed to be flexible. You can engage at different levels of commitment, from community ambassador to collective member to core owner. Many of our members maintain independent professional identities while collaborating through Rizom.

## What kinds of skills and backgrounds are you looking for?

We welcome diverse professional backgrounds and complement traditional expertise with additional qualities:

- Creative problem-solving abilities
- Collaborative mindset with strong communication skills
- Knowledge-sharing orientation and willingness to contribute to collective learning
- Self-direction and intrinsic motivation
- Adaptability and willingness to learn
- Alignment with our values of transparency, generosity, and purpose

We're particularly interested in professionals who feel constrained by traditional work environments and are seeking more meaningful collaboration.

## How is Rizom structured legally?

We operate through two main legal entities:
- **Cores**: Organizations responsible for client acquisition and project management (starting with Core 0 in the Netherlands)
- **INFRA**: The organization developing tools and methods to facilitate the collective (based in Singapore)

As a collaborator, you'll typically engage with us as an independent contractor signing directly with a CORE entity, maintaining your autonomy while accessing our ecosystem.

## Common questions and concerns

**"Is this just another freelancer platform?"**
No. Unlike platforms that simply match talent with work, Rizom creates an ecosystem where you collaborate as part of empowered teams with end-to-end product ownership. The revenue model, knowledge sharing approach, and growth opportunities all distinguish us from transactional platforms.

**"How stable is the work opportunity?"**
While we can't guarantee continuous work, our model is designed to create sustainability through:
- Cores absorbing client acquisition costs and risks
- Knowledge systems that help match you to appropriate opportunities
- Transparent revenue sharing that creates mutual interest in long-term success
- Multiple pathways to engagement beyond billable client work

**"Will I have to sacrifice my independence?"**
No. Rizom is designed to enhance, not restrict, your professional autonomy. You maintain control over which projects you join, how you approach your craft, and your level of engagement with the collective.

**"What if the concept doesn't work as planned?"**
We're building Rizom as an adaptable ecosystem that can evolve based on real-world feedback. Your participation helps shape our evolution, and our decentralized structure means different parts of the ecosystem can adapt independently as needed.
