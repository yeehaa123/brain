## 1. Opening: Intelligence as Practice
**Intelligence is agency — the resistance to chaos through purposeful practice**
- Intelligence is agency: anything that resists the natural tendency toward chaos and decay
- This resistance isn't a capability but a practice
- Practice requires: Knowledge (what to do) + Purpose (why resist) + Creativity (how to adapt)
- Agency emerges from practice — not programmed but developed through doing
- De Certeau: Practice creates spaces of freedom within structures
- Question: What kind of practices do our AI systems enable or prevent?

## 2. The AI Winters as Philosophical Graveyards
**Not funding droughts but selection events — which practices survive?**
- First Winter (1974-1980): Killed perceptrons and their promise of learning through experience
  - Practice lost: Bottom-up learning from data
  - Survived: Rule-based systems that offered explicit control
- Second Winter (1987-1993): Killed expert systems and symbolic reasoning
  - Practice lost: Human-readable knowledge representation
  - Survived: Statistical methods that promised scalability
- What survived both winters: The promise of control, prediction, and product
- Pattern: Each winter selects against approaches that emphasize emergent practice over engineered product

## 3. Cellular Automata: The Path Not Taken
**From Conway to distributed intelligence — why artists got it and tech didn't**
- Conway's Life: Universal computation from 3 simple rules
- Each cell's local practice creates global patterns
- Artists understood emergence:
  - [Casey Reas](http://reas.com/) — Processing co-creator, generative systems
  - [Ian Cheng](http://iancheng.com/) — "Emissaries" trilogy, BOB series with emergent narratives
  - [Pierre Huyghe](https://www.mariangoodman.com/artists/pierre-huyghe) — Living ecosystems like "After ALife Ahead"
  - [Hito Steyerl](https://www.davidzwirner.com/artists/hito-steyerl) — "Power Plants" critiquing/using AI systems
  - [Refik Anadol](https://refikanadol.com/) — Data sculptures using emergent patterns
- Intelligence as emergent effect, not delivered service

## 4. Why Neural Networks Won
**How the elimination of practice became a business model**
- During the AI winters, CA thrived in spaces where practice mattered:
  - Academic research: Complex systems, artificial life
  - Creative fields: Generative art, music, architecture
- But ignored by strategic tech, VC model needs predictable products, not unpredictable practices
- CA's emergent practices offered no control, no roadmap
+ Paradoxically, loss of control became motor for inflationary funding rounds
- Each funding round promises better execution: search → AGI → superintelligence
- Result: Intelligence as service, not practice

## 5. The Coming Winter as Opportunity
**Hype cycle ending = space for intelligence that practices**
- Signs: Scaling plateauing, promises failing, funding drying
- Winters are fertile: Time for practice over product
- Opportunity: Systems that develop agency through practice
- Example: Rizom Brains — autonomous knowledge agents developing intelligence through distributed practice
- Not competing with ChatGPT but enabling different practices

## 6. Conclusion: Choosing Practice
**We're at a crossroads in how we conceive intelligence**
- Two paths: Intelligence as service vs. intelligence as practice
- Last winter gave us deep learning. This one could give us practicing systems
- The question isn't "How do we build AGI?" but "What practices do we want to enable?"
- Our choice now shapes whether AI augments human
