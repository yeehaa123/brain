# Lumii x Rizom Collaboration 

## Executive Summary

Through a strategic partnership with Rizom, Lumii will be able to quickly validate product-market fit. Through a crowdfunding campaign that showcases the combined, total hardware and software proposition that Lumii will eventually offer, we effectively validate whether parents are willing to invest in this solution or not. 

Rizom brings a flexible, venture-building model — adapting its resources, talent mix, and strategies which could match Lumii’s evolving needs, ensuring we pivot quickly when new insights emerge. 

Collaborating together on a clearly defined pilot project allows us to validate whether the Rizom and Lumii partnership is fruitful with minimal risk.


## The Opportunity

Lumii has developed an innovative hardware prototype that has the potential to solve the global pathological myopia problem. It has decided to explore the direct to consumer route before trying to offer their unique sensor module to OEMs.


Lumii is aware that it cannot be a hardware solution alone. since the solution is primarily focused on children and adolescents, offering a playful engagement loop is an absolute requirement for retained use. This gamification system — which may involve multiple channel partners — still needs to be developed from scratch. Which is costly as long as the product-market fit for the hardware solution has not been established.

Instead of investing substantial amounts of money in building this gamification ecosystem right away, Rizom believes that it is better to first test whether this solution resonates with the end-users: parents and children.

### Key risks:

- Upfront development costs could be stellar without clear proof of ROI
- Parents love it, children hate it
- Customers like the solution in theory, but are not willing to pay a premium for it


## The Solution

To prevent raising the capital for developing the software upfront, Lumii will first focus on launching a crowdfunding campaign. Goal of this pilot project is to validate project-market phase.

Key in preparing this campaign is developing a so-called [visiontype](https://designmap.com/ideas/visiontypes-create-and-share-a-product-vision). A visiontype is comparable to a prototype but differs in one important way. Rather than showing the simplest version of the product, it showcases how a product could look like in 3 years. 

Once we have this visiontype, we can derive the artifacts (screenshots and descriptions) needed for the kickstarter campaign. This way, we validate the entire product ecosystem in the fastest and most cost-effective way.


Rizom can offer the talent and expertise needed to develop said visiontype and properly utilize it to achieve product-market fit.


## Project Objectives

The project is designed to:

1. Validate Lumii's combined software and hardware proposition through a focuses crowdfunding campaign.
2. Build and test a visiontype that can function as a northstar for the next 3 years of Lumii's product developments.
3. 
4. Test and document customer acquisition strategies providing Lumii with data-driven evidence of what works and what does not.
5. Develop a high-res product roadmap for year 1, and a low-res roadmap up until year 3.
6. Establish an outcome-base foundation for collaboration between Lumii and Rizom, ensuring Lumii can scale faster with a flexible, adaptive partner
7. De-risk future investments for Lumii by proving feasibility and market traction before committing significant capital
