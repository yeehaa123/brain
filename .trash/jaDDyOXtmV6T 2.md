    Generate a compelling call-to-action section for a personal knowledge
    management system.

    The CTA section should have:

    - A persuasive headline that creates urgency or excitement

    - A supporting description that reinforces the value

    - A primary button object with:
      - "text" field: Action-oriented text (e.g., "Start Free Trial", "Get Started Now")
      - "link" field: Appropriate link (e.g., "/signup", "/demo")
    - An optional secondary button object with:
      - "text" field: Alternative action text (e.g., "View Demo", "Learn More")
      - "link" field: Appropriate link

    Make it compelling and action-oriented. Remember that buttons must be
    objects with "text" and "link" fields, not strings.
