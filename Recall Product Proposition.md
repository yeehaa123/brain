# Recall

## Executive Summary

## Opportunity

Science has shown that knowledge sharing is key for building and maintaining happy, healthy, and productive teams. It has also observed, however, that building effective practices for knowledge sharing is a tasks where almost all companies fail, especially over time.

In practice, most knowledge sharing resolves around individual employees called 'catalysts'. These are people that possess key explicit and tacit knowledge about the organization that they share  — often unwittingly and/or unwillingly — with others. Without catalysts, most companies would fail.

However, from an organizational perspectives catalysts are an asset as well a liability. People leave, get sick, engage in office politics. All of these things, prevent knowledge from being shared optimally. As a matter of fact, most HR problems are due to the catalysts dependency. As long as most organization intelligence is stored in individual brains, there is a hard limit to organizational scaling. 

Rizom beliefs that by introducing intelligent agents that replace and augment existing knowledge sharing pratices, the collective intelligence of teams and the scalability of organizations can be greatly enhanced.


## Solution

Recall is a virtual catalysts that facilitates frictionless knowledge sharing. This intelligent agent externalizes a team's collective inteligence by capturing knowledge at those places where people already share them, such as: 

- communication tools (slack, teams, matrix) 
- company website 
- social media (linkedin, instagram, x and bluesky, substack), 
- productivity tools (office, gsuite, notion, obsidian, github).
- AI tools (chatGPT, claude, perplexity)

It captures all of this content which can then be remixed into different features

**Knowledge Oracle**: domain specific chat bot that is available in all team communication tools

**Topic Dictionary**: online registry of all important topics discussed throughout the entire knowledge base

**Conversation Summaries**: All conversation is automatically summarized into logical groupings over time

**Team Coach**: all communication is converted into actionable feedback by our unique algorithm based on the transactive memory (TMS) methodology

**Content Generation**: quickly draft content (blog article, social media posts, client proposal) based on your knowledge base 

Recall is a small easily hostable private server (web, api, mcp) that can be deployed almost anywhere. 

## Key Risks

- Customers find the problem abstract and do not see immediate benefits
- Employees refuse to work with AI that could replace them and may even actively sabotage its success
- Major AI companies solve this problem with a centralized solution
- Decentralized technology cannot offer the smooth UX that people need and want

## Risk Mitigators

- Independent professionals will quickly experience that Recall offers them a competitive edge.
- Recall can be developed and trained within Rizom itself and close partners before sold as a project
- Since we only deliver the last mile, advancements from the major AI providers will also benefit Rizom
- People will gradually move away from centralized solutions and business models
