# Recall

## Executive Summary

## Opportunity

Science has shown that knowledge sharing is key for building and maintaining happy, healthy, and productive teams. It has also observed, however, that building effective practices for knowledge sharing is a tasks where almost all companies fail, especially over time.

In practice, most knowledge sharing resolves around individual employees called 'catalysts'. These are people that possess key explicit and tacit knowledge about the organization that they share  — often unwittingly and/or unwillingly — with others. Without catalysts, most companies would fail.

However, from an organizational perspectives catalysts are an asset as well a liability. People leave, get sick, engage in office politics. All of these things, prevent knowledge from being shared optimally. As a matter of fact, most HR problems are due to the catalysts dependency. As long as most organization intelligence is stored in individual brains, there is a hard limit to organizational scaling. 

Rizom beliefs that by introducing intelligent agents that replace and augment existing knowledge sharing pratices, the collective intelligence of teams and the scalability of organizations can be greatly enhanced.


## Key Risks

- Customers find the problem abstract and do not see immediate benefits
- Employees refuse to work with AI that could replace them and may even actively sabotage its success
- Major AI companies solve this problem with a centralized solution
- Decentralized technology cannot offer the UX that people need and want
 

## Solution

Recall is a virtual catalysts that facilitates frictionless knowledge sharing. This intelligent agent externalizes a team's collective inteligence by capturing knowledge at those places where people already share them, such as: communication tools (slack, teams, matrix), website and social media (linkedin, instagram, x and bluesky, substack), and productivity tools (office, gsuite, notion, obsidian, github).

It captures all of this content which can then be remixed into different features
