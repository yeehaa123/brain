# Turn Your Team's Combined Knowledge Into Your Biggest Competitive Advantage

Your team has incredible collective expertise, but it's trapped in individual heads, scattered documents, and endless Slack threads. When someone is unavailable, projects stall. When team members leave, knowledge walks out the door. You're competing against larger organizations while your most valuable asset—your combined intelligence—remains fragmented.
