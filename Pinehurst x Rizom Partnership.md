# Pinehurst x Rizom Partnership Agreement

## Executive Summary

Pinehurst Studio and Rizom operate as strategic partners in digital transformation projects, combining complementary capabilities to deliver end-to-end venture building services.

Pinehurst contributes capital, strategic oversight, investor networks, and deal flow, while Rizom provides operational execution, product development, and go-to-market expertise. Together, they transform legacy businesses into digital-first ventures through a shared resource model and co-owned intellectual property.

The partnership operates on a project-by-project basis with defined roles, shared financial structures, and joint accountability for outcomes.


## Partnership Structure

This collaboration combines two distinct capability sets to deliver comprehensive venture building services. Pinehurst handles venture sourcing, deal structuring, capital coordination, and provides access to investor networks and strategic oversight. Rizom serves as the operational execution partner, delivering product development, go-to-market strategy, and technical implementation with milestone-based accountability.

Both partners jointly develop reusable frameworks, templates, and processes that scale across multiple ventures, creating shared intellectual property and operational efficiency.


## Investment Framework

Projects operate under a co-funded model where financial commitment and resource contribution are distributed across three sources:

- 35% Founder Capital: Cash or sweat equity from business owners and domain experts
- 35% Studio Capital: Combined resources from Pinehurst and Rizom partnership
- 30% External Capital: Investment from early-stage investors and angel syndicate participants

This structure ensures founder alignment while providing sufficient capital and expertise to execute transformation initiatives.


## Operational Framework

Each project follows a structured approach with defined phases, milestones, and governance checkpoints. Projects typically run 6-month validation cycles with clear success criteria and decision points for continuation or graduation.

Resource allocation combines founder domain expertise with the partnership's go-to-market capabilities, product development skills, operational execution, and investor network access.


## Project Governance

Individual projects are managed through separate Project Addendums that specify scope, deliverables, budget, timeline, resource allocation, and performance metrics. Regular milestone reviews ensure alignment and enable course corrections.

Projects reach completion when they achieve functional prototype status with revenue validation, or when both partners formally acknowledge delivery of agreed objectives.
