# Flow x Rizom Product Proposition

## Executive Summary

Flow produces acclaimed theater while simultaneously training the next generation of makers through a master-apprentice model. This approach works—masters transfer tacit, contextual knowledge that can't be taught in classrooms—but it doesn't scale. Masters can only mentor so many apprentices before quality degrades, and valuable insights get locked in one-on-one exchanges.

Barrio is a collaborative experiment between Flow and Rizom to extend the reach of masters without diluting their mentorship. At its core is Barrio Brain—a Rizom agent that captures video annotations and Discord conversations, transforms them into structured learning materials, and delivers that knowledge asynchronously to apprentices when and how they need it.

If Flow's masters can annotate a performance once and have that knowledge reach five apprentices instead of one, the rocket ship can carry more astronauts without adding more pilots.


## Opportunity

Flow provides cultural productions with a twist. Not only do they produce multiple high quality in-house and traveling theater productions a year, they also recruit and train the next generation of makers. In effect, this makes Flow a rocketship that trains its astronauts in flight. 

In order to transfer knowledge and skills that the new wave of talents need to perform in such a high pressure environment, Flow works with a master-apprentice model. This model is especially suited here because:

1. Flow's talent is highly motivated and often autodidact. They are thus less inclined to work with more conventional education formats.
2. A lot of the master's knowledge is tacit and contextual and thus not easy to capture in textbooks and lectures.
3. There is not enough time for 1 and 2 anyways.

Over the last few years, however, Flow has noticed this approach also comes with limitations. In particular, it has proven to be incredibly hard to scale beyond a handful of apprentices. 

Given Rizom's focus on scaling teams and organization around knowledge sharing, Flow approached Rizom if they could help build a knowledge sharing platform to scale their unique form of training and collaboration. 


## Solution

Barrio is an innovative tool that captures video that is indexable, linkable, and shareable for evaluation and discussion purposes.

It would consist of three components:

1. Flow's video component that provides multiple video streams of a performance
2. A curated community of makers on a Discord server
3. A bespoke Rizom agent called **Barrio Brain** that facilitates and moderates asynchronous and aspatial conversations between masters and apprentices

This brain would have the following features:

### Capture

Barrio Brain absorbs knowledge from multiple sources in Flow's ecosystem:

**Video annotation:** Masters can mark and comment on specific moments in performance recordings. These annotations become searchable knowledge that apprentices can access and learn from.

**Conversation harvesting:** Insights shared in Discord discussions are captured and indexed, so valuable exchanges between makers don't disappear into chat history.

**Context preservation:** Notes, feedback, and discussions are automatically linked to the specific performance footage they reference, maintaining the connection between tacit knowledge and its source.

### Remix

The brain transforms raw inputs into actionable learning materials:

**Structured feedback:** Scattered annotations and conversations are organized into coherent feedback packages tailored to individual apprentices.

**Learning paths:** Related content is connected across performances, creating navigable threads that trace how techniques develop or problems recur.

**On-demand formats:** The same underlying knowledge can be delivered as a quick chat response, a detailed written analysis, or a curated collection of video moments, depending on what the apprentice needs.

### Share

Knowledge flows to the right people through the tools they already use:

**Discord presence:** Barrio Brain lives in Flow's Discord server, where masters and apprentices can query it directly in conversation.

**Asynchronous bridging:** Time zones and schedules no longer limit mentorship. An apprentice in one location can receive a master's feedback while they sleep, presented in context.

**Permission-aware access:** Different levels of access ensure that sensitive critique stays private while general methodologies can be shared more broadly.


## Key Risks

- The master-apprentice model may prove to be fundamentally unscalable
- Transforming a rocket ship in motion is not easy
- Flow and Rizom's model of knowledge sharing may prove to be fundamentally incompatible
- Too many moving parts (video, community tool, etc.) could lead to high upfront investment, impure validation, or both
- An online discussion platform may not fit the needs and preferences of the makers
