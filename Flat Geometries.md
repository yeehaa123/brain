Everyone wants to flatten the hierarchy until they have to actually make a decision. Then suddenly we all remember why we invented org charts.

I've watched this play out enough times to recognize the pattern. A team commits to decentralized coordination. Meetings become longer. Consensus becomes a tyranny of the thoughtful. Someone eventually says "we need just a bit of structure" and three months later you're back to the same pyramid with slightly better vibes.

The problem isn't hierarchy itself. It's *where* hierarchy lives.

Traditional organizations treat hierarchy as a container for power—the boss has authority, so they make decisions. But that's backwards. Hierarchy should be a *shape for information flow*. The question isn't "who has the right to decide?" but "who actually knows what needs to happen here?"

When I built Offcourse, we tried hard to avoid this. Flat structure, consensus-based decisions, everyone has a voice. What we actually built was a system where the loudest voice and the person with the most patience won. Neither was usually the person who knew most about the problem.

Decentralized coordination works differently. Instead of removing hierarchy, it multiplies it. You create overlapping, temporary structures where decision-making authority moves based on context. The person deepest in a technical problem gets more weight on technical decisions. The person closest to users gets more weight on UX. This isn't egalitarianism—it's pragmatism.

The Rizom architecture is built on this. We use what I call "contextual authority"—roles that activate based on what's being decided, not permanent positions. A developer might lead on infrastructure choices, then step back when we're deciding on community guidelines. The geometry shifts. It's more like jazz than bureaucracy.

This requires something traditional hierarchies don't: radical transparency about *why* decisions are made. When power is centralized, you can get away with opacity. When it's distributed, every node needs to understand the reasoning or the whole system fragments. You end up writing more, explaining more, documenting more.

But here's what you get: decisions that actually account for the complexity they're facing. Not because everyone voted, but because the people who understand the terrain had space to shape the outcome.

The catch is you can't fake this. It requires genuine trust that people will make good decisions when given real authority. And it requires accepting that some decisions will be worse than if one smart person had just decided. The tradeoff is that more decisions will be *right* because they had input from people who actually live with the consequences.

The future of work isn't leaderless. It's *responsibly distributed*. The geometry matters.
