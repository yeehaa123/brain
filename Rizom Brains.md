# The Complete Knowledge Amplification Ecosystem

Knowledge work is transforming. Whether you're an independent expert, a collaborative team, or a distributed collective, the ability to capture, transform, and share knowledge effectively determines your competitive advantage. Yet most professionals struggle with fragmented tools, lost insights, and the challenge of scaling expertise without losing quality or autonomy.

Rizom's product line addresses the full spectrum of knowledge work through a family of intelligent brains, each designed for different scales and contexts while sharing the same powerful foundation.

## Capture: Universal knowledge ingestion across all contexts

- **Individual expertise preservation** - Personal brains that capture and organize your unique knowledge, building valuable intellectual assets over time
- **Team knowledge aggregation** - Collaborative brains that combine multiple perspectives while preserving individual contributions and ownership
- **Collective wisdom building** - Federated brains that enable distributed networks to share knowledge while maintaining autonomy and values alignment
- **Cross-brain synchronization** - Git-based architecture allows knowledge to flow between personal, team, and collective brains as needed
- **Universal input methods** - Consistent capture experience across all brain types through APIs, browser extensions, and platform integrations

## Remix: Adaptive transformation for every use case

- **Context-aware generation** - The same knowledge transforms differently for solo consulting, team collaboration, or collective action
- **Scale-appropriate outputs** - From personal project notes to comprehensive team proposals to multi-stakeholder collective reports
- **Audience adaptation** - Content automatically adjusts complexity and focus based on whether it's for internal use, client delivery, or public sharing
- **Values preservation** - All transformations maintain the principles and approaches of the originating context (individual, team, or collective)
- **Cross-pollination opportunities** - Insights from one brain type can inform and enhance outputs in others when appropriate

## Share: Distributed knowledge distribution at any scale

- **Flexible deployment models** - From personal cloud instances to team servers to distributed collective networks
- **Protocol compatibility** - All brains speak the same languages (HTTP, MCP, ACP) enabling seamless integration regardless of organizational structure
- **Graduated access controls** - From personal privacy to team collaboration to collective openness, with granular permission management
- **Ecosystem interoperability** - Brains can communicate and collaborate across organizational boundaries while respecting sovereignty
- **Universal AI integration** - Any brain can enhance AI tools and assistants, making artificial intelligence truly knowledgeable about your context

**The complete picture: Whether you're scaling individual expertise, amplifying team capabilities, or building collective intelligence, Rizom provides the knowledge infrastructure that grows with your ambitions while preserving what makes your work unique.**
