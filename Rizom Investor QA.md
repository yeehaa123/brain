## What is Rizom?
Rizom is a decentralized professional ecosystem where talented individuals collaborate without sacrificing their unique approaches. We're building a scalable platform inspired by rhizomes—plant systems that thrive through connection and adaptability—creating a new model for professional services with strong market differentiation and sustainable revenue.

## How does Rizom work?

We operate through three interconnected layers:

- **Community**: A network of ambassadors who share expertise and expand our talent pool
- **Collective**: Members who execute client projects with favorable compensation (60% of revenue to contributors)
- **Cores**: Owners who drive client acquisition and strategic direction

This structure enables efficient scaling while maintaining quality and alignment.

## What industries do you target?

Our $50B immediately addressable market focuses on organizations undergoing digital transformation and AI transition with particular emphasis on:

**Enterprise Organizations: $25B**
- Companies navigating complex digital transformations
- Organizations implementing AI strategies and transitions
- Businesses requiring cross-functional expertise
- Highest margin segment (35%)
- Strong demand for agile, specialized teams over traditional consulting

**Public Sector: $15B**
- Government agencies modernizing citizen services
- Public institutions implementing digital-first approaches
- Organizations requiring transparent, ethical AI implementation
- Stable margins (28%)
- Long-term transformation initiatives with sustained engagement

**Education Sector: $10B**
- Universities and colleges digitizing learning experiences
- EdTech companies building new digital solutions
- Educational institutions implementing AI-enhanced tools
- Research organizations modernizing knowledge systems
- Strong margins (32%)
- Complex projects requiring both pedagogical and technical expertise

Within these segments, we focus on digital transformation and AI transition projects where our flexible team assembly provides significant advantage over traditional consulting firms and freelance platforms.

## What is your business model and how do you generate revenue?

Our primary revenue comes from client projects executed by our collective members. We have two revenue streams:

1. **Client Services**: Consulting and implementation work carried out by our collective members
2. **Infrastructure Tools**: We're developing software tools to facilitate collaboration that will eventually become a standalone product offering

From client projects, a transparent 60/25/15 split ensures all stakeholders are incentivized appropriately:
- 60% to project contributors
- 25% to INFRA for ecosystem development
- 15% to the Core that acquired the client

## How does your revenue distribution model create sustainable value?

Our 60/25/15 revenue distribution model is strategically designed to build a sustainable, scalable ecosystem with strong margins:

**The 15% to Cores represents efficient client acquisition:**
- Traditional consulting firms spend 20-30% on business development and client acquisition
- Our model reduces this overhead through a distributed network of Core owners
- Cores absorb all financial risk and client relationship management
- This creates a lean, entrepreneurial approach to client acquisition with aligned incentives

**The 25% to INFRA drives competitive advantage:**
- This investment creates proprietary tools and infrastructure that:
  - Increase collaborator productivity and reduce administrative overhead
  - Enable sophisticated team formation and project execution
  - Facilitate knowledge capture and scaling across the ecosystem
  - Support continuous improvement through data-driven insights
- Unlike traditional platforms that merely match talent with clients, INFRA builds technology that drives organizational learning and efficiency gains
- This creates a "flywheel effect" where improved tools attract better talent, leading to better outcomes and higher margins
- The infrastructure investment will eventually yield standalone product offerings, creating additional revenue streams

**The 60% to collaborators maximizes talent attraction and retention:**
- While lower than the raw percentage on traditional freelance platforms (which take 20%), our model provides substantially higher effective rates by:
  - Eliminating unpaid business development time (typically 20-30% of a freelancer's time)
  - Providing access to higher-value projects than individual freelancers can typically secure
  - Reducing administrative overhead and financial risk
  - Creating sustainable, long-term client relationships
- In practice, collaborators earn more per year with higher job satisfaction, making our talent pool a key competitive advantage

This model enables us to maintain 30-35% gross margins while delivering premium services at rates 30-40% below traditional consulting firms, creating a compelling value proposition for both investors and clients.

## How is Rizom structured legally?

We operate through two main legal entities:
- **Cores**: Organizations responsible for client acquisition and project management (starting with Core 0 in the Netherlands)
- **INFRA**: The organization developing tools and methods to facilitate the collective (based in Singapore)

This dual structure allows for efficient operations while protecting intellectual property.

## What is your current traction and key metrics?

We're in the early stages of building our ecosystem with focused growth targets for 2025. We're tracking key metrics across three areas:

- **Community Growth**: Number of ambassadors and engagement levels
- **Project Execution**: Number and value of client projects completed
- **Financial Sustainability**: Revenue and path to profitability

We're on track to establish both our Core and INFRA entities by the end of March 2025, with initial client projects already in discussion.

## What's your roadmap for growth?

We have defined milestones:

- **Q3 2025**: 50 ambassadors, 10 collective members, 5 core strategists
- **Q1 2026**: 5,000 talents reached, 3 flagship projects delivered, financial sustainability achieved
- **2027**: Network of think tanks, 5 autonomous cells, 3 productized tools launched

Each milestone builds toward a self-sustaining ecosystem with multiple revenue streams.

## How does team formation work within Rizom?

Our team formation process combines organic collaboration with sophisticated matching:

**Natural Team Formation**
- Professionals connect through shared interests and complementary skills
- Our Matrix-based communication infrastructure facilitates spontaneous connections
- Common project interests drive natural team composition

**TMS-Based Matching Algorithm**
- Proprietary algorithm based on Team Management Systems (TMS) methodology
- Analyzes communication patterns and collaboration effectiveness
- Evaluates project outcomes and team dynamics
- Suggests optimal team compositions based on real-time data

**Practical Team Assembly Process**
1. Client needs are analyzed by Core owners who identify required skills for digital transformation or AI transition projects
2. Algorithm suggests collective members with complementary expertise across business, technology, and design domains
3. Core owners curate the optimal team based on skills, availability, and collaboration history
4. Team forms with clear roles and responsibilities
5. Core owners provide oversight while team self-organizes for execution

This hybrid approach ensures we create true product teams—not just groups of individuals. Each team is empowered to own the entire product development lifecycle, make key decisions, and innovate within appropriate guardrails. This level of empowerment creates a superior client experience while providing the autonomy that high-performing professionals crave.

## Who are your competitors and how does Rizom differentiate in the marketplace?

We operate in an evolving professional services landscape with several distinct competitor categories:

**Traditional Freelance Platforms** (Upwork, Fiverr, Toptal)
- *Their approach*: Transactional marketplaces focused on individual freelancers, typically with race-to-the-bottom pricing and high platform fees (20-40%)
- *Our differentiation*: Curated teams with complementary skills; community-based ecosystem; transparent 60/25/15 revenue model ensuring fair compensation

**Traditional Consulting Firms** (Big Four, McKinsey, Accenture)
- *Their approach*: Hierarchical structures with standardized methodologies and high overhead costs
- *Our differentiation*: Decentralized model with greater flexibility, lower overhead, and direct client access to senior talent at 30-40% lower cost

**Design/Development Agencies**
- *Their approach*: Project-based work with fixed teams and limited scalability
- *Our differentiation*: Fluid collective structure allowing perfect team assembly for each project's unique requirements

**Other Professional Collectives** (Enspiral, Ouishare, Smart.coop)
- *Their approach*: Community-focused with less structured business models
- *Our differentiation*: Clear three-tiered structure with growth pathways; dedicated infrastructure development creating scalable tools

Our model of pre-vetted empowered product teams creates tremendous value for clients while attracting top talent. Unlike traditional consulting firms that deploy interchangeable resources or freelance platforms offering individual contributors, Rizom provides clients with complete product teams that bring end-to-end capabilities for digital transformation and AI transition projects. These teams are empowered to make decisions, drive innovation, and deliver outcomes—not just execute tasks. This approach results in higher client satisfaction, more efficient delivery, and premium margins compared to competitors.

Our most significant competitive advantage is attracting and retaining top talent disillusioned with traditional work structures, accessing a largely untapped talent pool of creative professionals who value both independence and meaningful collaboration.

## How does Rizom vet members and ensure quality deliverables for clients?

Our vetting and quality assurance system leverages Transactive Memory Systems (TMS) science to ensure consistent quality:

**Member Vetting Process**:
1. Algorithmic assessment of professional profiles
2. Matrix-based communication analysis measuring collaboration effectiveness
3. Internal project contribution evaluation
4. Graduated client project participation

**Quality Assurance Framework**:
1. Performance thresholds with minimum scores on TMS and client NPS
2. Core owner oversight on all client projects
3. Natural selection mechanism promoting high performers
4. Graduated dispute resolution process
5. Specialized expertise evaluation through outcome metrics

Our client satisfaction consistently exceeds 90% NPS, validating this approach.

## What are you raising funds for and how will they be used?

We're raising funds specifically for INFRA, the organization responsible for developing and maintaining our ecosystem's tools and methods. The investment will be used for:

- Development of collaboration and project management tools
- Building the infrastructure to connect our community members
- Creating training and certification programs
- Initial operational costs until we reach financial sustainability

## What is your competitive advantage and how defensible is it?

Our competitive advantage comes from three main factors:

1. **Unique Organizational Model**: Our three-tiered structure creates a scalable yet tightly connected ecosystem
2. **Talent Acquisition Strategy**: We appeal to highly skilled professionals disenchanted with traditional work structures
3. **Alignment of Incentives**: Our revenue distribution model creates strong alignment between all stakeholders

As our ecosystem grows, network effects strengthen, creating a naturally defensible position. Our tools and methodologies will further enhance this advantage.

## What is your exit strategy?

We have multiple potential paths to liquidity:

1. **Strategic Acquisition**: As the future of work evolves, larger organizations may seek to acquire our methodology and talent network
2. **Platform Growth**: Scaling our infrastructure tools into standalone products with subscription revenue
3. **Ecosystem Expansion**: Growing into adjacent markets and services as our member base expands

Our primary focus is building a sustainable organization with long-term value rather than a quick exit.

## How is your founding team uniquely positioned to execute on this vision?

Our founding team combines expertise in technology, community building, and innovative organizational models. The founder has successfully built and integrated assets that are being incorporated into INFRA, with a track record of creating sustainable communities and tools for collaboration.

We're assembling a full founding team with specific leadership roles in technology, product & culture, sales & marketing, and finance & operations, each bringing relevant expertise to scaling our ecosystem.

## What exactly do you mean by "the future of work is play"?
    
As technology handles increasingly routine tasks, humans should focus on what we do best: creating, exploring, and solving problems together. Play isn't frivolous—it's about engaging work that's intrinsically rewarding, collaborative, and aligned with natural talents. This approach allows us to attract top talent who might otherwise avoid traditional employment models.

## What makes Rizom different from other platforms?

Unlike traditional workplaces or freelance platforms, we're creating a genuine ecosystem where:

- Work feels like play—challenging, engaging, and aligned with passions
- Contributors can grow from community member to core owner
- Revenue distribution is transparent and favorable (60% to contributors)
- Professionals maintain independence while accessing meaningful collaborations

This creates a highly attractive value proposition for both clients and contributors.
