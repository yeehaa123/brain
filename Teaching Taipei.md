I'd like to bring my experience as a founder and entrepreneur to business or entrepreneurship schools in Taiwan.

A bit about my background: I'm a founder, entrepreneur, writer, developer, and ecosystem architect exploring the intersection of technology, culture, and organizational design.

I've built and scaled multiple ventures: Varias, a digital product agency I grew to $3M ARR with a team of 50 before exiting; Offcourse, an open-source learning platform reimagining education outside institutional walls; and Superconnectors Network. 

Currently I'm building Rizom, a decentralized platform reimagining how independent professionals and AI collaborate — part of a broader vision for the future of work.

My approach to innovation is shaped by an unusual path: a PhD in Philosophy, teaching at the University of Amsterdam where I developed **Coding the Humanities** where we let students develop hands-on coding and entrepreneurial experience. 

All this combined, gives me a perspective that bridges theory and practice — I can talk about why organizations work the way they do, not just how to optimize them.

What I can offer: courses, workshops, or guest lectures on topics like:

- **The Future of Work** — why traditional employment is breaking down, and what's replacing it
- **Building with AI** — practical frameworks for integrating AI into products, teams, and workflows
- **Ethics of Innovation** — how to build technology that aligns with human values, not just market incentives
- **Decentralized Organizations** — how networks outperform hierarchies, and how to design for collaboration at scale

I could commit up to one or two days per week. Happy to discuss what might be a good fit.
