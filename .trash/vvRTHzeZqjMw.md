    Generate a features section for a personal knowledge management system.

    The features section should have:

    - A label (e.g., "Features")

    - A headline explaining the value proposition

    - A description of what makes these features special

    - 3-4 feature cards, each with:
      - An icon name (e.g., "lightning", "lock", "check", "chart", "users")
      - A compelling title
      - A brief but informative description
      - Optional color scheme (purple, orange, or teal)

    Focus on benefits like speed, security, ease of use, and collaboration.
