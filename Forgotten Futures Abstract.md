## Abstract

This talk excavates AI’s buried histories to uncover alternative futures for creative practice. Between the celebrated breakthroughs and dominant narratives of artificial intelligence lie forgotten territories: the ‘AI winters,’ abandoned research paradigms, and discontinued computational philosophies that promised different relationships between mind and machine.

Rather than viewing these as historical dead ends, I trace how these lost lineages might have evolved alongside, and even enriched, the experimental methods driving today’s generative art. What if cellular automata had remained central to AI development instead of being relegated to mathematical curiosities? How might creative AI look today if distributed, emergent computation had flourished rather than being overshadowed by centralized neural architectures?

By mapping these forgotten futures — particularly the rich tradition of cellular automata from Conway to Wolfram — I explore how recovering abandoned approaches could fundamentally transform the intersection of technology, creativity, and politics, offering new possibilities for intelligence that emerges from simple, local interactions rather than massive, centralized systems.

## Bio
 
 Jan Hein ‘Yeehaa’ Hoogstad  is the founder of Rizom and holds a Ph.D. in Philosophy from Utrecht University. His work bridges technology, arts, and politics through projects like the award-winning “Augmenting Masterpieces” and pioneering digital humanities education initiatives.

Operating at the intersection of entrepreneurship and scholarship, Yeehaa investigates how alternative technological genealogies can reshape creative and collaborative practices.
