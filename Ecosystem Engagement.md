### **Definition of Leaders (our talent)**

**Leaders:** In Jan Hein's strategy, leaders are purpose-led individuals who have a vision for the bigger picture and are committed to promoting equal opportunities worldwide. These leaders can come from various backgrounds, including social enterprises, non-profits, academia, or independent initiatives. They are characterized by their drive to make a positive impact, a holistic view of systems, and a focus on collaboration, open knowledge sharing, and fostering inclusive environments.

### **Definition of Company Leaders/CEOs (our target group)**

**Company Leaders/CEOs:** These are leaders specifically in executive roles within organizations. They are often in "Founder mode," highly involved in the early stages of scaling their companies. They focus on both strategic and operational aspects, aiming to maintain the core values and ethos of their organization while addressing growth challenges such as scalable knowledge transfer and effective delegation. They are driven by both commercial success and the broader vision of their company’s impact in the market.
