# Lumii x Rizom Partnership 

## Executive Summary

Through a strategic partnership with Rizom, Lumii will be able to quickly validate product-market fit. By launching a crowdfunding campaign that showcases the combined hardware and software proposition that Lumii will eventually offer, we can effectively validate whether parents are willing to invest in this solution.

Rizom brings a flexible, team-building model — adapting its resources, talent mix, and strategies to match Lumii's evolving needs. Rizom enables Lumii to have a complete [empowered product team](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Empowered%3A+Ordinary+People%2C+Extraordinary+Products-p-9781119691297) without the need to hire this talent upfront.

Collaborating on a clearly defined pilot project allows us to validate whether the Rizom and Lumii partnership is fruitful with minimal risk.

## The Opportunity

Lumii has developed an innovative hardware prototype that has the potential to solve the global pathological myopia problem. The company has decided to explore the direct-to-consumer route before offering their unique sensor module to OEMs.

Lumii recognizes that hardware alone cannot be the complete solution. Since their product primarily targets children and adolescents, offering a playful engagement loop is an absolute necessity for sustained use.

This gamification system — which may involve multiple channel partners — still needs to be developed from scratch, which is costly as long as product-market fit for the hardware solution has not been established.

Instead of investing substantial amounts upfront in building this gamification ecosystem, Rizom believes it is better to first test whether this solution resonates with the end-users: parents and children.

## Key Risks

- Upfront development costs could be substantial without clear proof of ROI
- Parents love it, children hate it
- Customers like the solution in theory but are not willing to pay a premium for it
- Hiring talent before their need is established and validated
- Insufficient proprietary IP to protect from competitors

## The Solution

To avoid raising capital for developing the software upfront, Lumii will first focus on launching a crowdfunding campaign. The goal of this pilot project is to validate product-market fit.

Key to preparing this campaign is developing a so-called [visiontype](https://designmap.com/ideas/visiontypes-create-and-share-a-product-vision). A visiontype is comparable to a prototype but differs in one important way: rather than showing the simplest version of the product, it showcases how a product could look in 3 years.

Once we have this visiontype, we can derive the artifacts (screenshots and descriptions) needed for the Kickstarter campaign. This way, we validate the entire product ecosystem in the fastest and most cost-effective manner.

Rizom can offer the talent and expertise needed to develop this visiontype and properly utilize it to achieve product-market fit.

## Project Objectives

The project is designed to:

1. Validate Lumii's combined software and hardware proposition through launching a focused crowdfunding campaign in collaboration with Rizom
2. Develop a visiontype that can function as a north star for the next 3 years of Lumii's product development
3. Document customer acquisition strategies, providing Lumii with data-driven evidence of what works and what does not
4. Define a high-resolution product roadmap for year 1, and a low-resolution roadmap through year 3
5. Evaluate which channel partners are needed and, if any, which ones
6. Establish an outcome-based foundation for collaboration between Lumii and Rizom, ensuring Lumii can scale faster with a flexible, adaptive partner
7. De-risk future investments for Lumii by proving feasibility and market traction before committing significant capital
