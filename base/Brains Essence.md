Rizom's product offering consists of a series of so-called brains. Brains assist professionals with all activities that involve knowledge sharing, whether that is within a team, with others, or even with yourself.

In essence, brains do three things: capture, remix, share
## 1. Capture: Brains are a central place to store your knowledge  
## 2. Remix: Brains organize and augment your knowledge into a shape that you or others need it to be in

## 3. Share: Brains make it easy to share it with other people or AI agents
